    This small porcelain thimble is chased in scarlet and has a crimson silk slip cover. The markings on the thimble itself are minute and depict a cheerful but strained proprietor hawking various wares from a cart.

    If the bearer spills enough of their own blood into the thimble to fill it, they are unable to use any magic for the day, though they find all mundane ventures one step easier. Each time the thimble is used, it seems to grow in size.

    This lapis lazuli pendant is miraculously strung not with wire but with thin ironoak, mysteriously supple whilst held. The engraving on the pendant shows a woman offering her cloak while snow falls thick.

    Anyone whom the wearer lends clothing to finds that they are utterly immune to the cold. Until the item is returned, the pendant wearer frosts everything they touch, though their extremeties slowly become frostbitten over the next several days unless the item is returned or they give away something else.

  description: |
    This small stone tablet depicts a pair of men holding hands as they share a single bowl of noodles, their eyes bright and laughing. Gazing on it for more than a few seconds fills your nostrils with the rich smell of charred ginger and roasted onion.

    While holding the tablet and looking at it, you can whisper a short message to the last person you shared a meal with and they will hear you, wherever they are. Using the tablet makes you ravenously hungry.

  description: |
    This thick ring is made of smoothly polished granite and topped with an ironoak relief of the watchful moon at its zenith over a berry bush. It smells of crushed raspberries.

    The bearer of this ring is compelled to kiss it and to seek out fruits to satisfy their newfound sweet tooth; every day that circumstances keep them from eating such fruit they become bitterly selfish. All tastes become extraordinarily more potent, their tongue an order of magnitude more sensitive.

    This celadon linen skirt features beads of porcelain sewn into the image of a vibrant and joyous woman dancing in the street. At the waist, a band of silk with opalescent scrollwork in whorls and waves.

    The wearer finds that their every step is sure and they alway feel like dancing. Anyone who sees the wearer danced is entranced; the less they already like the wearer, the more they find they cannot tear their sight away.

  description: |
    This bronze kopis is wickedly sharp, chipped and very slightly bent, the bronze splashed with dried blood. The hilt is decorated with dozens of platinum eyes shut tight.

    When the blade is dipped in a being's blood the eyes open wide, revealing golden orbs, and the bearer sees the moments leading to the injury from the being's perspective; if the **bearer** spilled the blood, they instead see the being's most happiest memory from their perspective.

  description: |
    This thin ironoak stylus is used to apply kohl powder to the eyes and has a thin lavender silk ribbon depicting entwined fingers. Close inspection shows that each pair of hands is different, never repeating.

    When used to apply kohl to one's own eyes, the user finds their steps light, almost bounding from earth with the slightest effort. When applied to anyone else, they step slowly and surely with a resounding thud, as if weighed down by responsibility.

  description: |
    This olive-handled khopesh has a Pentolan marble blade, pale green veined with gray. The hilt is polished smooth and inlaid with tiny discs of gold which hum softly unless in moonlight.

    When the curved blade inflicts a wound it calcifies the damaged flesh, leaving an obvious marble scar and preventing most forms of mundane healing without further surgery.

    These puce drakeleather vambraces are tooled meticulously in the image of roiling flames, the heart of each of them embossed with bronze.

    When worn, anything held in either hand shrinks to half its normal size in a flash of scorching light, returning to normal size when let go, but glowing-hot.

  description: |
    This bronze disc is engraved with an ancient juniper thick with berries, piles of the berries building small mounds all around the base. From the top of the disc dangles a rich blue silk ribbon, long enough to tie.

    If you eat juniper berries beneath the disc, you find that your age reverses by one day per berry eaten.

  description: |
    This socket-axe is hafted onto stout ironoak, the shaft a well-sanded and oiled octagon. The head itself is shaped like a rising flame, the bronze flashing in the light, the lines of the inner flame made of tiny runic ears.

    When held aloft, the bearer may roar with the sound of a thousand infernos, overwhelming everyone nearby.

  description: |
    This small willow shield is sheathed in tin polished mirror-smooth. The boss itself is made of delicate porcelain in the shape of the moon, marring the otherwise perfectly reflective surface of the shield.

    Any damage to this shield quickly reverts under direct moonlight, returning to the perfectly polished and smooth state in mere moments. If the porcelain of the boss is ever cracked, the object or person who broke it is yanked, hard, a dozen feet towards the moon, wherever it currently is.
