    This bronze statue depicts lovers feading each other chunks of bread dripping honey, their limbs entwined. Their lips are stained red with dried blood.

    Any food eaten in the presence of these statues without a loved one robs the food of all taste; even the simplest fare is delectable if shared with a friend or partner.

  description: |
    This diorama of a marble moon suspended over a pond of saphhire is pleasantly abstract, not bothering to mimic proper proportions; the surface of the moon is polished somehow to feel like velvet. Beneath the flat surface of the pond, a dozen tiny precious stones.

    Any stone placed on the pond's surface sinks slowly in moonlight, shrinking to a tenth its size. Retrieval of the gems does not seem possible without breaking the moon, based on my research.

    This bust of a Pentolan matron with flames for hair is surprisingly lifelike, down to every wrinkle in her serenely thoughtful face. Her eyes, looking upward, are made of porcelain, and what appears to be dried blood has trickled from her ears.

    Thinking while looking into a fire while touching this bust causes the flames themselves to visualize your thoughts, a flickering panorama.

    This stone toy soldier fits in the hand and features a spearwoman holding her own helmeted head under her arm, her spearblade bright with polished iron. In every crease, pale red mold seeps like fungal blood.

    The bearer of this tiny statue can scrape up a modicum of the mold, prick their finger on the spear, and mix the two together to ingest; after doing so, the statue grows to the same size as them and takes orders until the sun rises again.

    This copper plate is etched with an almost pleasantly interpretive scene of lightning striking a willow tree growing strange fruit. Where the lightning blasts the tree, tiny slivers of iron have been carefully inserted; picking it up always causes an uncomfortable shock.

    Any tree this tablet is nailed to will be struck by lightning whenever a storm blows through; if it survives the blast, it the fruit from the etching grow from its branches. When eaten, they taste of ozone and the consumer's breath is filled with lightning that crackles between their teeth.

    This clay tablet is shaped like a cackling merchant in eerily lifelike detail, gazing at a hoard of gold and silver playing cards falling through their fingers. In their yawning mouth grows a mold like dried blood.

    When this tablet is hung in a room, everyone who can see it feels a growing desire to count their material wealth. We verified the claim of the prior owner that scraping the mold and mixing it into a tea allows the drinker to eat precious objects, staving off illness and aging for a time correlating to the perceived value of the objects eaten.

    This simple earthenware cup is a perfectly shaped cylinder, as wide as it is tall, marred only by the Pentolan obsession with imagery, in this case depicting a bonedrake with molten stone (stylized with tiny rubies) dripping from its bony plates.

    Anyone who drinks from this cup feels intensely warm, sweating despite even the coolest night breeze. Any drake bonded with the drinker shares the effect, only amplified tenfold, to the point their bony plates sear a fresh egg instantly.

    This bronze pruning shear is bedecked with small emeralds, it's blades shaped like Pentolan playing cards with marble statues for the Matron and Captain.

    Any fruit clipped with these shears turns to a porous clay, easily chewable. Anyone who eats this fruit slowly turns to stone, starting with their teeth; if they do not bite someone else to transfer the effect by the next sunrise, they will become a statue.

    This small statue of a giant padma flower smells like its namesake and has petals of rusted iron. On its base, a sharp pin.

    If the bearer pricks themself with the statue, the flesh around the mark necrotizes and their flesh warps to present the same flower. The spike stamens can be removed and pressed into another living being, infecting them with the parasitic plant too. For sunrise the plant is not spread, more of the host's flesh decays. An infected host is immune to disease and poison.

    This mirror is made from meticulously polished gold, chased with a love poem in tiny iron script.

    Looking into the mirror shows not oneself but their beloved. If looking in direct sunlight, all wounds and illness fade from the reflection and person alike; if in moonlight, they age rapidly and terribly.

    This thornwillow basket has a silk cover stitched with golden thread depicting the sun above a peaceful glade, strewn with various items.

    Anything placed into the basket is lost forever, stitched into the cover; the bearer can perfectly recall any memories made while holding the lost item, regardless of whose mind they live in.
