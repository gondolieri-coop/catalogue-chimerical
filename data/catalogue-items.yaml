    This lifelike bronze statue depicts lovers feading each other chunks of bread dripping honey, their limbs entwined. Their lips are stained red with dried blood.

    I was able to verify the seller's claim that any food eaten in the presence of these statues without a loved one robs the food of all taste; even the "simplest" fare is delectable if shared with a friend or partner. Experiments showed that this sentimentality is, indeed, critical; though of course, Pentolan cuisine is needlessly over-handled.

    This diorama of a marble moon suspended over a pond of saphhire is pleasantly abstract, not bothering to mimic "proper" proportions; the surface of the moon is polished somehow to feel like velvet. Beneath the flat surface of the pond, a dozen tiny precious stones.

    Any stone placed on the pond's surface sinks slowly in moonlight, shrinking to a tenth its size. Retrieval of the gems does not seem possible without breaking the moon, based on my research.

    This bust of a Pentolan matron with flames for hair is vividly lifelike, down to every wrinkle in her serenely thoughtful face. Her eyes, looking upward, are made of porcelain, and what appears to be dried blood has trickled from her ears.

    The artisan was able to demonstrate that thinking while looking into a fire while touching this bust causes the flames themselves to visualize your thoughts, a flickering panorama.

    This stone toy soldier fits in the hand and features a spearwoman holding her own helmeted head under her arm, her spearblade bright with polished iron. In every crease, pale red mold seeps like fungal blood.

    Astonishingly, I confirmed that the bearer of this tiny statue can scrape up a modicum of the mold, prick their finger on the spear, and mix the two together to ingest; after doing so, the statue grows to the same size as them and takes orders until the sun rises again. Obviously, this borders on heresy; though as the work itself was authored and only performs as directed, it is less heretical than the authorless works authorlessly working common in this city.

    This copper plate is etched with an almost pleasantly interpretive scene of lightning striking a willow tree growing strange fruit. Where the lightning blasts the tree, tiny slivers of iron have been carefully inserted; picking it up always causes an uncomfortable shock.

    I verified the claim attached to this tablet at auction: that any tree this tablet is nailed to will be struck by lightning whenever a storm blows through; if it survives the blast, the fruit from the etching grow from its branches. When eaten, they taste of ozone and the consumer's breath is filled with lightning that crackles between their teeth. A refreshingly enlightened (for a Pentolan artisan) work.

    This silver tablet is small enough to hold in one hand and inlaid with aquamarine and topaz, depicting a bustling snow-blanketed market with dozens of people trading and conversing. The entire thing is lined with iridescent opaline scrollwork of tiling snowflakes.

    The artisan's claim for this work took frustratingly long to prove: when the bearer of this tablet's breath frosts in the air, they find that haggling comes easy to them, as does accurate appraisal for any goods being sold. Anyone attempting to mislead the bearer finds their lips blue visibly while doing so. Not very useful, given that such a climate is only seen for a few days a year in our homeland.

    This clay tablet is shaped like a cackling merchant in eerily lifelike detail, gazing at a hoard of gold and silver playing cards falling through their fingers. In their yawning mouth grows a mold like dried blood.

    Horrifyingly, when this tablet is hung in a room, everyone who can see it feels a growing desire to count their material wealth. We verified the claim of the prior owner that scraping the mold and mixing it into a tea allows the drinker to eat precious objects, staving off illness and aging for a time correlating to the perceived value of the objects eaten.

    Purchased from an unfortunate gladiator's auction after seeing it in use and verified again after. Smearing one's own blood onto the blade of either axe allows the bearer to pull it free from the tablet, upon which they grow to full size and cleave through anything but iron with ease. They shrink again when the blood covering them dries.

    I was able to verify this work only by use of a Truthing dweomer on the seller's witness. When one of the attached charms is removed and fed to someone younger than the owner, the child miraculously comes into wealth and luck at every turn; however, equal misfortune befalls the owner.

    This sketchbook is half-filled with disturbingly accurate anatomical studies of various people, the copper plates that cover it etched with a pleasingly abstract rendering of a human heart.

    I verified the prior owners claim by personal demonstration of the seller; anyone who details a loved one with their own hand in this book creates a link between the artist and the subject, such that ailments and injuries upon the subject are rendered upon the artist and the illustration alike instead of the subject. Erasing an illustration reportedly severs the link but reportedly kills the subject immediately; the seller was unwilling to prove this point.

    This painting of a wealthy person framed in porcelain flame depicts them looking on as a pile of visible wealth burns, as Pentolan Spirons do every seventeen years, a ritualized rejection of the wealth they continue to possess.

    I verified the seller's claim; the owner of this painting can push any item they own into the painting, slowly rendering it into the painting. The owner can later pull a copy of any item they placed in the painting, but it crumbles into ash at the next moon zenith. It is important that the item be given or sold; theft reportedly does not confer ownership.

    I validated this work via meticulous experimentation and documentation. When three or more people join hands and _dance_ around a flame in the presence of this illustration, they are imbued with the _dance of the flames_ commensurate to their magnitude until the fire dies. If purchased, this item will include my analysis of the foolish soft art this work engenders in participants. It is fascinating, if utterly obscene.

    When the Cold Front came through the city I was finally able to properly confirm the claim attatched to this work at auction; when unfurled, everyone nearby finds even the coldest day easy to endure, though their eyes slowly take on the color of the diamond. In my experimentation, this effect fades after about an hour. Useful perhaps for anyone travelling to colder climes, especially those trekking far hubward.

    Purchased at auction and verified, anyone who draws a stick figure in this book and signs it with their name will regain as many years of youth as they draw lines for their figure. Drawing a second figure, however, reverses the effects threefold. The experiment subject was recompensed accordingly.

    This simple earthenware cup is a perfectly shaped cylinder, as wide as it is tall, marred only by the Pentolan obsession with imagery, in this case depicting a bonedrake with molten stone (stylized with tiny rubies) dripping from its bony plates.

    I had the donar validate their claim and then independently validated it myself with a mercenary drakerider; anyone who drinks from this cup feels intensely warm, sweating despite even the coolest night breeze. Any drake bonded with the drinker shares the effect amplified to the point their bony plates sear a fresh egg instantly. This does not seem to harm the drake in any noticeable way.

    The seller proved the veracity of the claimed effect of this work by way of incorrigibly rude demonstration. When drinking from this cup, all observers find themselves impressed by the drinker's good taste and bearing, making them the most interesting and laudable person in the room. The seller reported that the drinker is similarly overcome with feelings of self satisfaction and a desire for more, more, more accolades; this was confirmed via the Truthing dweomer.

    This work was verified only by extensive use of the Truthing dweomer. For every year that this chamber pot is used daily an additional crack filled with bronze slowly grows. Whoever used the pot at least daily during that year finds themself inured against any illnesses or poisons consumed. Only a Pentolan would author such an obscene work.

The wearer of this armor can, in direct sunlight, pull a peach from it, the fruit materializing in their hand and disappearing from the artwork. For ten minutes after eating the peach the wearer is nigh invisible in shade but leaves behind a strong scent of crushed peaches.

    I verified both functions of this work at great, though worthy, expense; I did not, however, thoroughly replicate the experiment due to the associated costs. The wearer can block or deflect any incoming blow, reducing it to nothingness; doing so rusts one of the iron veins to nothing. If used against iron, the deflected item is destroyed and a vein is restored.

    This item was donated without explanation as to effect, I discovered and analyzed it via experimentation. The wearer of this helm feels and hears a soft crackling at all times, an endless nagging; by focusing on it, they cause a bolt of lightning to shoot from their eyes, robbing them of their vision temporarily but ending the crackling for a time.

    This work was purchased from a gladiator who demonstrated its use in exchange for temporary patronage.

    This work was donated by an eyeless old enlightened marine who confirmed the effects via the Truthing dweomer. Whenever the bearer of this shield faces an enemy with greater wealth or standing their eyes slowly turn to turquoises over the course of a minute; when the transformation is complete, they become something like a battle spirit, powerful and deadly, and cannot stop until they kill their foe; when they do, the turquoise eyes fall out and their own grow back slowly over the course of a day.

If the bearer of this shield scrapes some of the mold into the mouth of an injured comrade, their wounds seal as if time reversed itself in their flesh, though the bearer's bones creak as they age a year for each injury so undone. As backwards as Pentolan medicine is, this work came at an enormously steep cost; we might think they would invest more in their education but, of course, they prefer to fall back on the Craft they only half understand.

    This draketooh's shaped halberd's head is held to the stave with golden pins and is etched with a snarling drake engulfed in roaring flames.

    Purchased from the surviving family member of a "retired" Gondolieri, I validated this seller's claims during an expedition into the Undercity. When presented before any hostile beast it gives the creature pause and redirects their ire toward whatever the halberd is pointed at next.

    This otherwise pleasingly simple crossbow's handle is studded with tiny amethysts and agates in the form of kissing folk surrounded the swirling dust of the Violet Storm.

    I was surprised to find that the donar's claims about this work proved out in experiments; any dweomer the bearer knows can be manifested through a bolt loaded into this crossbow, obviating the need for any other targeting or distance calculations in the dweomer's application.

    This flimsy copper khopesh is utterly plain and cheap save for the extravagant iron edge welded to it which undulates like lapping flames up the curved weapon.

    Brief experimentation with this work proved to me that to wield this blade is to fight sluggishly as if underwater; to strike with this blade is to burn through stone like butter.

    This six yard long pike is tipped with a blade of porcelain shaped like a skyward-reaching flame. All other flames in its presence seem somehow hungry and hateful, burning hot and smoky.

    Purchased from a Spearspire auction, used in one of the sundry scuffles againt that militant spire. Interview via Truth dweomer of the incarcerated former bearer indicated that the wielder of this pike feels the destructive hunger of every flame near them while they hold it; if they give into this hunger, they can hear the whispers of the flames telling them how to hurt and harm anyone the flames perceive. A strange item to make, possibly authorless as the Pentolans do not always fully intend their own works.

    This massive crossbow's heavy trigger lever is made from ornately forged iron in the shape of a family of artisans showing each other their works; from the butt dangles a pale yellow silk tassel.

    While I was unable to verify the seller's claims myself, I was able to contract with some locals and the claim proved true: any bolt fired from this weapon made by a loved one impacts twice as hard and rips through magic as if it wasn't there; any other bolt impacts half as hard as normal and any magic inherent to it is nullified. Sentimental, but possibly of great value to any family with a fletcher (if they can stomache the imagery).

    This ironoak bow is strongly recurved and smells faintly of sumac. The horn tips are carved with images of rolling fields of plenty.

    Donated without any note, this item's effect was discovered by happy accident of a recalcitrant mentored youth, whom I then showed proper experimentation procedures. Any arrow deliberately loosed into the ground will snap the bowstring; however, so long as the arrow is not removed from the earth all things around it will grow heavy and thick unless tended by the archer.

    This thin forked throwing dagger is made from surprisingly sturdy porcelain in the shape of a tall thin tree burning from a lightning strike that split its trunk. Its handle is wrapped in pale silk.

    Purchased from the artisan who made it, they were willing to testify to its effect under a Truthing dweomer. When the bearer of this throwing dagger throws it into a surface marked with their own blood causes the blade to become a conduit for a fearsome lightning strike, forking one of the split halves of the tree again. The artisan declined to explain their reasoning for creating it, stating only "It speaks for itself."

    This jagged mageglass dagger's handle is sheathed in dimpled bronze rather than wrapped in the usual silk. Held in a fire, the flame's colors shift to a dark purple, dimming the area as the flames slowly starve.

    I was able to verify the seller's claim of this work's primary effect myself: the bearer of this dagger can feed flame, magical or mundane, to it and later imbue any dweomer of their own with the stolen flame though the handle heats painfully while they do so. Unfortunately, we discovered during replication that it must not be dropped while in the heated state, lest the wielder be engulfed instead. The participant was healed and recompensed threefold for their suffering, as the Great Treatise requires.

    While I was skeptical of the detailed notes detailing this work by the donar, they bore out: when bearer of this mace strikes with it in moonlight and calls out to the moon, they draw its attention as a bolt of burning moonlight sears the spot they struck; until the moon sets, however, its gaze does not leave the bearer. Pentolans report this as uncomfortable, but they are quite superstitious.

    I found good opportunity to test this work's effect when a woman injured in one of Pentola's many streetfights came to us for succor; if the bearer of this blade cuts themself and mixes their spilling blood with the wound of another, the wound burns closed safely, if painfully; until the next sunrise, however, the bearer's own bleeding will not even slow. Luckily, it does not take a _large_ cut of the wielder to manifest the effect. Another mark of Pentola's rank ignorance of medicine and the Great Treatises.

    Donated to us by the Skylion Spiron's nibling in thanks for saving their friend's life after falling from a training griffin, its effect verified under the Truthing dweomer. The bearer of this axe finds themselves the friend of any raptor or griffin they encounter; a griffin who licks the axe head becomes bonded to it, willing to follow the bearer like kin.

    This work was confiscated from a pair of thieves caught attempting to leave our grounds with sundry common goods; when worn, everyone working around the wearer feels their steps are light, effortless, regardless of how much they carry or long they work. The thieves have since become students in our weekly courses and seek enlightenment earnestly, if clumsily.

    The artisan of this work sold it to us when their patron defaulted on payment and was willing to describe and demonstrate it in detail. While worn, the wearer cannot help but be noticed by anyone and everyone; merely looking at the hat in passing captures the attention to a degree that requires an onlooker to consciously wrestle their gaze away. The interview with the artisan is, of course, included in my larger corpus of analysis, but I am happy to include a copy of it with purchase.

    This work was donated with simple notes which required rather intensive experimentation to verify: anyone who eats beside the bib-wearer tastes only copper, all things rendered to taste like blood unless they deign to kiss the bib, further polishing the iron. Anyone who does so instead finds every morsel delectable, perfect to their taste regardless of actual composition. Another mostly pointless Pentolan work obviated by gardening according to The Great Treatises.

While worn, the wearer's hands are as youthful and spry as when they were teenagers, all aches and stiffness held off until the gloves are removed. After the effects were confirmed, the gardener declined to retake possession of the gloves, preferring to work in sacred harmony as is correct.

Each ship may be used three times before it rusts to nothing.

    Purchased at auction after the Dawndrake Race, verified by the previous owner via the Truthing dweomer. While worn, the wearer can channel the rage of the depicted drakerider, all aggression coming easy and fast, though they become single-mindedly focused on conflict and victory until they drop from exhaustion or the tunic is removed by someone else.

    Purchased from a widower and confirmed via the Truthing dweomer: while worn, any matrix the wearer holds can be used by a loved one, so long as they entwine their fingers with the wearer. Any dweomer cast through the matrix is twice as powerful if cast this way. An astonishingly narrowly authored work unfortunately rife with base Pentolan sentimentality.

    Sold by the aunt of the artisan who made it after he failed to return from the Catacombs, I was able to verify the claimed effect via experimentation: if this sash is wrapped around flora planted in ash and left where it will get sunlight, the plant will grow as if a week has passed for each sunrise. Every dawn another amethyst grape vanishes. Dozens of grapes remain.

    Purchased at auction after seeing it used in a gladiatorial exhibition, the trigger confirmed by the previous owner via Truthing dweomer. Anyone whose blood is splashed or smeared on one of the tunic's skeletons while it worn is overwhelmed by excruciating pain as their marrow heats rapidly; if they do not flee beyond the wearer's sight, they will be fully engulfed in flame after a minute.

    Purchased at auction, the notes for this work covered only its primary effect, which I verified: when the wearer screams while the moon is overhead they become the source of an eldritch blast that escapes their lips in a shattering wave; unfortunately, I also discovered that until the next moonrise, they can hear nothing but their own echoing scream.

    Discovered in the belongings of a Pentolan guest of the Farewell Ward, I discovered this effect via meticulous experimentation. While worn, the imagery animates in slow motion; any drakes older than the wearer treat them as offspring, younger drakes treat the wearer as a parent. The effect seems to wear off slowly unless the brooch is held by another, in which case it immediately transfers.

    Purchased from a second-hand shop without any accompanying notes, this work's effects were discovered purely via experimentation: while worn, the wearer has an exceptional sense of taste, enabling the discernment of flavor from across the room. If the pin is dipped into something and then licked, the bearer uncannily knows precisely what they are tasting, so long as they have tasted it before.

If the daffodil blooms fully, the wearer knows the specifics of everyone's covetous thoughts.

    Gifted by a Pentolan ambassador, this work's effects were confirmed to my satisfaction: when the wearer kisses someone they have feelings for their body shifts, molding itself towards their own idealized form; in exchange, they become less physically attractive to whoever they kissed.

    Donated by a Pentolan guest in our Farewell Ward, she attested to this work's effects via the Truthing dweomer: anyone wearing this circlet does not age so long as they are wet by rain or groundwater. If the wearer wets their hand on the disk and touches someone with that hand, they can freely transfer days of their life to and from the target. I suspect that her use of this work is what brought her to our Farewell Ward, but she was disinclined to answer me.

    Recovered from a heretic murderer, I confirmed the witnessed effect to court satisfaction and kept it for additional analysis. Anyone the wearer's foot rests on in direct moonlight is weakened enormously, unable to do more than breathe. For a minute after they are out of direct moonlight, they are instead as hale and hearty as they have ever been.

    This work was one of the belongings left in the will of a reformed Pentolan; I was able to piece together its effect by discussion with their survivors and confirm it myself. If the bearer breaks something they own with this hammer gravity loosens its grip on them; for as many moonrises as seasons they owned the item, they leap and move as if they weighed a tenth as much.

    Purchased at auction, I was able to verify the primary effect of this work: the bearer can use this hammer to crush any bone in their own body with the slightest touch, filling them with tephra, supercharging any and all magic until the next moonrise. Unforunately, I also discovered that a bone broken this way never heals, not even with all the knowledge available to our healers in The Great Treatise.

Any fruit clipped with these shears turns to a porous clay, easily chewable. Anyone who eats this fruit slowly turns to stone, starting with their teeth; if they do not bite someone else to transfer the effect by the next sunrise, they will become a statue.

    Recovered from a mournful guest of our Farewell Ward who had been paid to use this work on behalf of Spire Basilisco; before their long sleep, they confirmed this work's effects via the Truthing dweomer. If the bearer pricks themself with the statue, the flesh around the mark necrotizes and their flesh warps to present the same flower. The spike stamens can be removed and pressed into another living being, infecting them with the parasitic plant too. For every sunrise the plant is not spread, more of the host's flesh decays. An infected host is immune to disease and poison. While I have preserved this work in accordance with my duties, I do recommend that it be kept in archive or destroyed when sufficiently studied.
