## Feast of the Ancient Juniper

This bronze disc is engraved with an ancient juniper thick with berries, piles of the berries building small mounds all around the base. From the top of the disc dangles a rich blue silk ribbon, long enough to tie.

If you eat juniper berries beneath the disc, you find that your age reverses by one day per berry eaten.

## Marine's Struggle

This charcoal drawing of a fierce ship-boarding battle has more _feeling_ than detail, showing swirling smoke and mortal struggle. The few pieces of armor depicted are made of iron shavings, not coal, and flicker violently in firelight.

Staring too long at this illustration fills the viewer's ears with the din of a hard-fought battle. For the next week, they are particularly attuned to the sounds that accompany violence, picking them out easily even a hundred yards away.

## The Winter Aristocrat's Dinner

This painting of a thin, beautiful, long-haired person eating a luxurious feast alone at a table in the snow is, at first glance, a wonder. Closer inspection shows shadowy figures shivering at the edges in the dark, left out. Whatever figures were once painted there are covered now by a soft, porous mold that peels away easily but seems endless.

If the keeper of this painting ever refuses to share food, they find one of their digits slowly becomes frostbitten, but the person to whom they refused succor begins to turn in that same time to snow, their flesh giving way to separating crystals.

## Friendfeast Cup

This simple cup is glazed a pale orange, its thick rim made of smooth Pentolan marble featuring reclining friends chatting and drinking together. When left in the dark, it hums quietly, reminding listeners of their favorite tune.

Any non-alcoholic liquid drunk from this cup tastes like and has the effect of clean, cool water, regardless of origin. Any alcohol drunk from the cup is three times as potent in taste and effect.

## Leapfast Flask

This clay flask is glazed in the Pentolan style, depicting figures in their linen panoply dancing above yawning crevasses made of cracks filled with some dark gum.

The old sea captain who sold it explained that pouring drinks for one's own followers loosens gravity's grip on them til the next dawn, which he used to keep his rigging-climbers safe.

## Pitcher of the Fruit Vendor's Morn

This pitcher is rimmed with Pentolan marble and has dozens of tiny iron charms pressed into it, each shaped like a tiny fruit stand.

When a single slice of fruit is placed into it along with any drinkable liquid, the liquid is infused with the flavor of that fruit as if a full day had passed. Anyone who consumes a drink poured from this pitcher feels as if they've just awoken from a restful night's sleep.

## Boulder Slinger Statue

This small granite statue depicts an androgynous slinger whirling a massive sling bullet with grim determination on their face. Their eyes are inlaid with platinum which turns the color of any light reflecting off of it a pale red.

The bearer of this statue finds the weight of any and all stone to be reduced to a twelfth; to everyone else, it weighs just the same as they would expect.

## Hearty Ship

This 1:600 scale model of a Pentolan warship is, perhaps, useful to study for future conflict; the entire thing is made of ironoak and assembled with precision, a full replica.

I am assured by both the impoverished captain who auctioned this item as well as our own verification that so long as this ship is floated in water any effects of aging or sickness will effect the model instead.

## Moonmirror

This hand-wide statue of the Watchful Moon floats eerily a foot above whatever surface it is placed upon, sitting perfectly still in space. It is made entirely of wrought iron.

Anything lit by light reflected from this statue becomes weightless while so lit. Anything lit by actual moonlight reflected from this statue withers quickly away, aging a year each second it is exposed.

## Moonroot Tablet

This azure-lacquered tablet has a moon-bent tree made from polished ironoak laid into its face, the roots of which entangle each other and protrude from the tablet to end in small spikes.

When a group of people prick their finger upon the roots of the tree together, the root painfully breaks from the tablet, lodging itself as a splinter. Those who bear the splinters alway know the precise direction and distance to one another but also find themselves overcome with lust for each other when in moonlight.

## Tablet of the Beloved's Banquet

This small stone tablet depicts a pair of men holding hands as they share a single bowl of noodles, their eyes bright and laughing. Gazing on it for more than a few seconds fills your nostrils with the rich smell of charred ginger and roasted onion.

While holding the tablet and looking at it, you can whisper a short message to the last person you shared a meal with and they will hear you, wherever they are. Using the tablet makes you ravenously hungry.

## Embrace of the Violet Storm

This pink silk waist wrap features purple threads in the image of the Violet Storm, strewn with tiny amethysts. Picking it up causes a powerful static shock.

The wearer of this wrap does not appear to age but feels an overpowering desire to go out and brave the Violet Storm when it comes. If they do survive, the effects of the wrap endure even when not worn. If the wrap is ever removed, they age as if ten times as much time had passed since they first wore it.

## Longworker's Gloves

These sky-blue drakeleather gloves feature small opals set into the first knuckle of each digit. A purple-gray mold grows in the shape of the Watchful Moon from the palm of each glove, regrowing in moonlight if scraped away.

The wearer's hands never tire nor grow sore from work. The mold can be infused and drunk as a tea; the wearer finds the tea deeply bitter but others find it sweet and rejuvinating, filling them with energy as if they'd just woken from a relaxing nap.

## Lover's Light Robe

This short pale red linen robe has silver wire sewn through its edges displaying handsome men embracing. At the sleeves, tiny iron charms in the shape of faces, eyes closed, lips puckered.

While worn by someone in love, all light is brighter, everything more visible. When worn by someone who loves no-one, all light fades, hiding the wearer in shadow.

## Mintstorm Tunic

This tunic is idiomatic of Pentolan fashion, woven from some alchemically cultivated form of mint, and it smells like it. Darker leaves are woven around the hem in the shape of storm clouds.

After discussion with the auctioneer, we tested and verified that the tunic makes the bearer extremely prone to lightning strikes, but immune to their destructive power.

## Moonshrouded Shirt

This deep purple linen shirt is sewn with extraordinarily thin iron wire in the shape of a cloud-shrouded moon over the right breast. Between the wires grows a pale green mold, clinging to the shirt in flaky outgrowths.

The wearer can always see the moon's outline, no matter what it is hidden behind. In moonlight, the mold grows noticeably. If scraped from the shirt, the mold can be ingested to give the consumer uncanny sight in moonless darkness.

## Skirt of the Dancing Step

This celadon linen skirt features beads of porcelain sewn into the image of a vibrant and joyous woman dancing in the street. At the waist, a band of silk with opalescent scrollwork in whorls and waves.

The wearer finds that their every step is sure and they alway feel like dancing. Anyone who sees the wearer danced is entranced; the less they already like the wearer, the more they find they cannot tear their sight away.

## Starburst Veil

This sienna veil is fringed with bronze stars, each bearing an opaline heart. The cloth itself is thick and soft, falling in luxurious folds.

Anyone other than the wearer who attempts to lift the veil to see their face is instead blinded by a dozen brilliant starbursts of colorful light which continue to explode painfully in their mind until the veil is dropped once more.

## Winter's Breath Jacket

This thick dawn-gray linen jacket is stuffed with goose down and features golden thread woven into the hems and into an esoteric rune on the back which looks like a distorted snowflake made of arrowheads.

The wearer never feels the cold though their breath always clouds in a thick fog. Snow which lands on the jacket is immediately subsumed by it, disappearing in a flash of steam.

## Bear's Fury Piercings

This pair of dermal piercings are in the shape of roaring bear's heads, carved of ironoak and thinly coated with a pale blue-gray mold in the crevices.

While worn in the flesh, whichever muscles the piercings were inserted into swell in size, as if perfected by years of training. The blue mold can be scraped and devoured to spread this effect throughout the body for ten minutes, but makes the imbiber violently ill for an hour afterward.

## Carbuncle's Friend

This thin copper anklet is studded with half a dozen carbuncle eyes, crudely--though not hideously--set.

While worn, any carbuncles in the area are drawn to the wearer, docilely rubbing their bodies up against the wearer's foot.

## Frostgiver Pendant

This lapis lazuli pendant is miraculously strung not with wire but with thin ironoak, mysteriously supple whilst held. The engraving on the pendant shows a woman offering her cloak while snow falls thick.

Anyone whom the wearer lends clothing to finds that they are utterly immune to the cold. Until the item is returned, the pendant wearer frosts everything they touch, though their extremeties slowly become frostbitten over the next several days unless the item is returned or they give away something else.

## Infernally Bound Chain

This thin silver chain has seven polished iron links strewn through it. When near a fire, it fills the air with the smell of heady incense smoke.

The wearer is immune to any and all affects of heat, magical or mundane. For every minute they expose themselves to heat which would cause them harm, one of the iron links will heat to a white glow, cooling one after another each hour. If all seven become hot enough to glow, the wearer is immediately immolated.

## Lightning's Scar Brooch

This tin brooch is shaped like a lightning-struck tree, with a dozen forks of lightning made from carefully inlaid porcelain, some of them broken.

When the wearer nears a tree devastated by lightning, they are drawn to it. Placing a hand upon the charred husk transfers some of the heat of the strike to the wearer, searing their hand. The full impact of all lightning strikes thus absorbed will be released if any fork of porcelain lightning is ever broken.

## Moonberry Ring

This thick ring is made of smoothly polished granite and topped with an ironoak relief of the watchful moon at its zenith over a berry bush. It smells of crushed raspberries.

The bearer of this ring is compelled to kiss it and to seek out fruits to satisfy their newfound sweet tooth; every day that circumstances keep them from eating such fruit they become bitterly selfish. All tastes become extraordinarily more potent, their tongue an order of magnitude more sensitive.

## Peacelily Ring

A small copper ring with a razor sharp porcelain peace lily erupting from it, stained with blood that obstinately refuses wash out.

When the bearer pricks their own finger on the flower, the tempers of everyone nearby are said to cool considerably, robbing them of violent and hurtful thought.

## Tumblespire Brooch

A porcelain clasp for cloaks with small iron charms laid into it depicting one of the cities spires in various states of collapse. This spire does not seem to exist.

This brooch was recovered from a hanged thief who sought to use it to pull down our embassy in this debaucherous place. Under... questioning, he admitted he had been instructed to slide the pin into the mortar of a central pillar, which would collapse the building after three cycles of the moon.

## Flamekeeper Vambraces

These puce drakeleather vambraces are tooled meticulously in the image of roiling flames, the heart of each of them embossed with bronze.

When worn, anything held in either hand shrinks to half its normal size in a flash of scorching light, returning to normal size when let go, but glowing-hot.

## Myopic Drakemask Helm

This extravagant bronze helm is polished mirror bright and includes an ironoak face mask carved like a raging drake with a hole for the mouth but not eyes. From the carved eyes run rivulets of blood, seemingly fresh.

When the facemask is in place, the bearer can see nothing but their enemy, whom they see moving in slow motion compared to their own reflexes. For every minute the helm is worn, the bearer's tears will be bloody for one day.

## Raptorhelm

A hemisphere of dull bronze chased with tarnished silver depicting ravens attacking and a golden eagle cawing.

The last bearer was always attacked on sight by corvids when the moon was up until, finally, one removed her eye and she elected to give up the helmet. She swears she dreamt of the golden eagle but could never understand its caws.

## Shared Memory Skirt

This enamelled linen skirt depicts warriors facing outwards, swords drawn, each clasping hands with another. Every third panel of the skirt is made of thin Pentolan marble carved the same, except the warriors are looking at each other.

When worn, the air smells faintly of mint and pepper. The wearer may clasp hands with someone and both can see a shared memory as if it is reoccurring right now, but from the other's perspective.

## Spearscale Coat

This coat of tiny bronze scales has several precious iron scales sewn into its chest in the image of a brilliant spearhead, the top scales stained red with blood that never cleans off.

While worn, this coat of scaled imbues the wearer with a powerful lust for glory and battle, filling their belly with fire. Their hand becomes quick to violence, their mind slow to think about anything else.

## Anchortoss Buckler

This small buckler is pleasingly shaped, a polygon with nine sides. The boss is an eleven-sided polygon with a tiny iron charm in the shape of an anchor set upon it.

Held, this shield is remarkably light and mobile. Thrown, it impacts like a boulder tossed by a war machine.

## Lightkeeper Shield

This siege pavis is a relic of older days, out of fashion even by Pentolan standards. It is constructed of ironoak boards with a lavish golden lantern carefully inlaid upon its face, always bright.

My research has shown that this shield absorbs some amount of all the light directed at it and, if tapped hard against the ground, will unleash this stored light in a cone before it from the lantern's golden flame.

## Moonpull Buckler

This small willow shield is sheathed in tin polished mirror-smooth. The boss itself is made of delicate porcelain in the shape of the moon, marring the otherwise perfectly reflective surface of the shield.

Any damage to this shield quickly reverts under direct moonlight, returning to the perfectly polished and smooth state in mere moments. If the porcelain of the boss is ever cracked, the object or person who broke it is yanked, hard, a dozen feet towards the moon, wherever it currently is.

## Flameroar Axe

This socket-axe is hafted onto stout ironoak, the shaft a well-sanded and oiled octagon. The head itself is shaped like a rising flame, the bronze flashing in the light, the lines of the inner flame made of tiny runic ears.

When held aloft, the bearer may roar with the sound of a thousand infernos, overwhelming everyone nearby.

## Last Sight Kopis

This bronze kopis is wickedly sharp, chipped and very slightly bent, the bronze splashed with dried blood. The hilt is decorated with dozens of platinum eyes shut tight.

When the blade is dipped in a being's blood the eyes open wide, revealing golden orbs, and the bearer sees the moments leading to the injury from the being's perspective; if the **bearer** spilled the blood, they instead see the being's most happiest memory from their perspective.

## Mace of Avarice & Ease

This small solid silver mace is perpetually a little damp. Each of the seven flanges are etched with images of prosperity and good fortune; a lawyer, thief, warrior, painter, merchant, chef, and musician.

Anyone struck by this mace becomes greedy, exponentially more motivated by the promise of wealth and recognition. The bearer themself is inured to any such impulses for as long as they hold the mace.

## Marblewound Khopesh

This olive-handled khopesh has a Pentolan marble blade, pale green veined with gray. The hilt is polished smooth and inlaid with tiny discs of gold which hum softly unless in moonlight.

When the curved blade inflicts a wound it calcifies the damaged flesh, leaving an obvious marble scar and preventing most forms of mundane healing without further surgery.

## Myopic Moplah

A broad-bladed sword with a widely curving tip, the small guard made of marble and the grip opaline, depicting a lavish villa above the sea.

Acquired from a warrior who was laid low in a street fight, struck from behind. Witnesses reported that she seemed wholly unaware of anyone and anything except for the person she had begun attacking, though the blade reportedly sheared through her target's blade, shield, and body alike.

## Pike's Tooth

This bronze blade is thick, almost beautiful, a twisting three-pointed star that rises to a sharp point like a Pentolan Pike's bite, it's pommel a flat wooden disc with a strange rune burned into it.

Forged as a gift to a Gascon who died en route to the city, this weapon makes even a slow warrior fast, enabling them to stab with supernatural speed if they stand upon the waves.

## Rod of the Oathkeeper

This thick marble rod is wrapped in well-oiled orchid-pink drakeleather and has three long silk ribbons dangling from the thinner end, each depicting a gracious and magnanimous captain being admired by their warriors.

When the bearer of this rod touches it to the lips of someone who fights for them, that person is imbued with incredible alacrity so long as they respect and admire the bearer. If they are hostile, the bearer instead is frozen in place, unable to move for one minute.

## Stormbreaker

This small bronze handaxe is capped with a lightning-shaped spike of polished iron. The haft is made from scorched olive wood. Picking it up brings forth a powerful smell of ozone.

When held aloft in a storm this axe draws the full fury of the skies upon itself; the bearer's body is immune to the destruction, which rapidly transfers from the weather into the weapon, affecting everything nearby.

## The Would-Be Spiron

This ash crossbow has a stave of pentolan marble carved with a relief of the Pentolan skyline, spires rising from the canals below. Despite its impossible construction, the crossbow is relatively easy to cock, the marble bending mysteriously.

The bearer of this crossbow finds themselves exceptionally hungry for renown and lucre alike; while using it in the service of those goals, they find that their aim is unerring, but they seem incapable of calculating risks.

## Bloodflame Dish

This soup dish is carved from a single piece of Pentolan marble, a roiling flame of stone spreading from its belly which is stained dark with blood.

When food is mixed with the consumer's own blood, the consumer finds themself utterly immune to flame, smoke, and heat until they have finished digesting the meal; at that point, the consumer becomes violently ill for a day, vomiting flammable blood.

## Bloodflame Stone

This small jasper pebble is polished smooth and soft to the touch, almost squishy when held between two fingers. The swirls in its surface are remeniscent of a starting flame, just now catching hold.

When pressed into an open wound, the bearer finds that the wound will not close and burns painfully, rendering the limb it was placed in nearly useless. In exchange, however, the bearer may touch any friendly beast, imbuing it with the spirit of flame, granting it immunity to fire even as it ignites into living flame. The stone cannot be removed except by amputation.

## Pedestal of Thundering Thought

This squat Pentolan marble pedestal is capped with a mirror of bronze, the surface of which causes a painful shock when touched.

If an item is placed upon this pedestal beneath a clear sky it will be destroyed in a sudden and vicious bolt of lightning. For the next hour, the person who placed the item can hear the thoughts of its rightful owner. For the rest of the day, they are deafened by the echoes of thunder.

## The Comrade's Bowl

This shallow olive bowl is entirely unremarkable save for the golden spear head hammered into its belly and the fact that it is always and forever damp.

If the keeper of this bowl places their own food into the bowl, they find that it is incredibly nutritious and tasty, feeding half-a-gross of other people with a single morsel. The keeper of the bowl, however, gains no nourishment from that or any meal for three days.

## The Deck of Nails

This small box is carved of Pentolan marble in the shape of a box of playing cards common to Pentola. When opened, all nearby light dims until the lid is closed again. Inside, a deck of 40 plain linen cards, a handful of them marked with pips eerily reminiscent of fingernails.

The bearer of this box may pull their fingernails and place them upon a blank card; each fingernail so placed grants one minute of perfect health, near immortality, to the bearer. A Fingernail so used never grows back.

## Thimble of Bloodsweat Endeavors

This small porcelain thimble is chased in scarlet and has a crimson silk slip cover. The markings on the thimble itself are minute and depict a cheerful but strained proprietor hawking various wares from a cart.

If the bearer spills enough of their own blood into the thimble to fill it, they are unable to use any magic for the day, though they find all mundane ventures one step easier. Each time the thimble is used, it seems to grow in size.

## Beloved Memory Machete

This copper machete has acid-etched imagery of seven people holding hands and leaning against each other. The handle is wrapped in silver wire. When held aloft, the scent of jasmine fills the air.

The bearer of this impossibly sharp and durable machete finds that, when used to clear brush, their mind drifts back towards their loved ones. If used on flesh, memories of their loved ones fade forever with each stroke.

## Bloodgrin Saw

This porcelain handled woodsaw has a bronze blade, the teeth immaculate but shaped like a terrifyingly bloodstained grin.

Anything cut with this saw appears to bleed, regardless of material, seeping a small amount of fresh blood. Whatever is cut away with this saw remains weightless, floating in the air.

## Burning Desire Whetstone

This pale gray whetstone is set into an oblong disk of gold and has a silk tassel attached to a protrusion on one end. The tassle seems to dance like a falling ember whenever it is not gripped tight.

Using this whetstone to sharpen an implement of any sort fills the user with a keen and overwhelming desire to use that implement; the sooner the better, and with little regard for consequences.

## Friendmaking Handtruck

This handtruck features a thick bronze pry at the base of a long ironoak handle with two stubby wheels. Tiny iron charms in the shape of hearts dangle from the spokes of each wheel.

When used to move heavy objects, people treat the user with a degree of familiarity directly proportional to the weight of the load being moved. For the user, the load is always light as a feather until unloaded.

## Heartrend Saw

This little handsaw is unbelievably extravagant and impractical, made of silver with iron teeth forge welded on. Between the teeth, pale yellow mold furs.

The donator noted that this saw can be used on oneself to remove any and all romantic feelings toward someone, the mold furring more thickly. If ingested, the mold induces vivid dreams of loves consumed by the saw.

## Hundredhand Kohl Stylus

This thin ironoak stylus is used to apply kohl powder to the eyes and has a thin lavender silk ribbon depicting entwined fingers. Close inspection shows that each pair of hands is different, never repeating.

When used to apply kohl to one's own eyes, the user finds their steps light, almost bounding from earth with the slightest effort. When applied to anyone else, they step slowly and surely with a resounding thud, as if weighed down by responsibility.

## Linecutter Shears

A pair of copper shears, the handles banded with porcelain etched like crashing waves. The blades are shaped like the prows of warships rather than practical triangles.

Sold as part of an auction of items recovered from pirates, verified to be capable of slicing through anything the bearer believes to belong to a sworn enemy.

## Moonbattle Brush

This stiff brush has tiny bristles of iron wire and is of the same sort used to clean armor after battle. On the bristles grows a pale mint mold which tastes of freshly cut lime.

When used to polish any metal clean, it makes the object impossibly reflective, returning an order of magnitude more light than is shone upon it until the next time it is in moonlight.

## Mooniron Mortar and Pestle

This mortar and pestle are made from bluish granite, though cracks in the mortar have been filled with iron polished smooth. In moonlight, the pestle is twice as heavy but seems capable of grinding anything.

When used to prepare herbs, the keeper of this culinary tool finds that their entire prep work flows fast and smooth as if nothing can go wrong. Any meal eaten with crushed ingredients from this mortar and pestle taste distincly metallic, but time seems to pass 3/4 as fast for the eaters til their next meal.

## Tireless Handtruck

This simple wooden handtruck has a too-thin iron lever at the bottom but nevertheless is capable of bearing any load lifted upon it.

When used to transport anything, the user of this handtruck finds that they are tireless, able to work for hours without feeling any strain, though observers note that they do show it, nonetheless. When the user lays down to sleep, they remain in a deep slumber for as twice as many hours as they used the handtruck.
