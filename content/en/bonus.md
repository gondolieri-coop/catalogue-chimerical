## Thimble of Bloodsweat Endeavors

This small porcelain thimble is chased in scarlet and has a crimson silk slip cover. The markings on the thimble itself are minute and depict a cheerful but strained proprietor hawking various wares from a cart.

If the bearer spills enough of their own blood into the thimble to fill it, they are unable to use any magic for the day, though they find all mundane ventures one step easier. Each time the thimble is used, it seems to grow in size.

## Frostgiver Pendant

This lapis lazuli pendant is miraculously strung not with wire but with thin ironoak, mysteriously supple whilst held. The engraving on the pendant shows a woman offering her cloak while snow falls thick.

Anyone whom the wearer lends clothing to finds that they are utterly immune to the cold. Until the item is returned, the pendant wearer frosts everything they touch, though their extremeties slowly become frostbitten over the next several days unless the item is returned or they give away something else.

## Tablet of the Beloved's Banquet

This small stone tablet depicts a pair of men holding hands as they share a single bowl of noodles, their eyes bright and laughing. Gazing on it for more than a few seconds fills your nostrils with the rich smell of charred ginger and roasted onion.

While holding the tablet and looking at it, you can whisper a short message to the last person you shared a meal with and they will hear you, wherever they are. Using the tablet makes you ravenously hungry.

## Moonberry Ring

This thick ring is made of smoothly polished granite and topped with an ironoak relief of the watchful moon at its zenith over a berry bush. It smells of crushed raspberries.

The bearer of this ring is compelled to kiss it and to seek out fruits to satisfy their newfound sweet tooth; every day that circumstances keep them from eating such fruit they become bitterly selfish. All tastes become extraordinarily more potent, their tongue an order of magnitude more sensitive.

## Skirt of the Dancing Step

This celadon linen skirt features beads of porcelain sewn into the image of a vibrant and joyous woman dancing in the street. At the waist, a band of silk with opalescent scrollwork in whorls and waves.

The wearer finds that their every step is sure and they alway feel like dancing. Anyone who sees the wearer danced is entranced; the less they already like the wearer, the more they find they cannot tear their sight away.

## Last Sight Kopis

This bronze kopis is wickedly sharp, chipped and very slightly bent, the bronze splashed with dried blood. The hilt is decorated with dozens of platinum eyes shut tight.

When the blade is dipped in a being's blood the eyes open wide, revealing golden orbs, and the bearer sees the moments leading to the injury from the being's perspective; if the **bearer** spilled the blood, they instead see the being's most happiest memory from their perspective.

## Hundredhand Kohl Stylus

This thin ironoak stylus is used to apply kohl powder to the eyes and has a thin lavender silk ribbon depicting entwined fingers. Close inspection shows that each pair of hands is different, never repeating.

When used to apply kohl to one's own eyes, the user finds their steps light, almost bounding from earth with the slightest effort. When applied to anyone else, they step slowly and surely with a resounding thud, as if weighed down by responsibility.

## Marblewound Khopesh

This olive-handled khopesh has a Pentolan marble blade, pale green veined with gray. The hilt is polished smooth and inlaid with tiny discs of gold which hum softly unless in moonlight.

When the curved blade inflicts a wound it calcifies the damaged flesh, leaving an obvious marble scar and preventing most forms of mundane healing without further surgery.

## Flamekeeper Vambraces

These puce drakeleather vambraces are tooled meticulously in the image of roiling flames, the heart of each of them embossed with bronze.

When worn, anything held in either hand shrinks to half its normal size in a flash of scorching light, returning to normal size when let go, but glowing-hot.

## Feast of the Ancient Juniper

This bronze disc is engraved with an ancient juniper thick with berries, piles of the berries building small mounds all around the base. From the top of the disc dangles a rich blue silk ribbon, long enough to tie.

If you eat juniper berries beneath the disc, you find that your age reverses by one day per berry eaten.

## Flameroar Axe

This socket-axe is hafted onto stout ironoak, the shaft a well-sanded and oiled octagon. The head itself is shaped like a rising flame, the bronze flashing in the light, the lines of the inner flame made of tiny runic ears.

When held aloft, the bearer may roar with the sound of a thousand infernos, overwhelming everyone nearby.

## Moonpull Buckler

This small willow shield is sheathed in tin polished mirror-smooth. The boss itself is made of delicate porcelain in the shape of the moon, marring the otherwise perfectly reflective surface of the shield.

Any damage to this shield quickly reverts under direct moonlight, returning to the perfectly polished and smooth state in mere moments. If the porcelain of the boss is ever cracked, the object or person who broke it is yanked, hard, a dozen feet towards the moon, wherever it currently is.

## Bear's Fury Piercings

This pair of dermal piercings are in the shape of roaring bear's heads, carved of ironoak and thinly coated with a pale blue-gray mold in the crevices.

While worn in the flesh, whichever muscles the piercings were inserted into swell in size, as if perfected by years of training. The blue mold can be scraped and devoured to spread this effect throughout the body for ten minutes, but makes the imbiber violently ill for an hour afterward.

## Infernally Bound Chain

This thin silver chain has seven polished iron links strewn through it. When near a fire, it fills the air with the smell of heady incense smoke.

The wearer is immune to any and all affects of heat, magical or mundane. For every minute they expose themselves to heat which would cause them harm, one of the iron links will heat to a white glow, cooling one after another each hour. If all seven become hot enough to glow, the wearer is immediately immolated.

## Boulder Slinger Statue

This small granite statue depicts an androgynous slinger whirling a massive sling bullet with grim determination on their face. Their eyes are inlaid with platinum which turns the color of any light reflecting off of it a pale red.

The bearer of this statue finds the weight of any and all stone to be reduced to a twelfth; to everyone else, it weighs just the same as they would expect.

## Burning Desire Whetstone

This pale gray whetstone is set into an oblong disk of gold and has a silk tassel attached to a protrusion on one end. The tassle seems to dance like a falling ember whenever it is not gripped tight.

Using this whetstone to sharpen an implement of any sort fills the user with a keen and overwhelming desire to use that implement; the sooner the better, and with little regard for consequences.

## Lightning's Scar Brooch

This tin brooch is shaped like a lightning-struck tree, with a dozen forks of lightning made from carefully inlaid porcelain, some of them broken.

When the wearer nears a tree devastated by lightning, they are drawn to it. Placing a hand upon the charred husk transfers some of the heat of the strike to the wearer, searing their hand. The full impact of all lightning strikes thus absorbed will be released if any fork of porcelain lightning is ever broken.

## The Winter Aristocrat's Dinner

This painting of a thin, beautiful, long-haired person eating a luxurious feast alone at a table in the snow is, at first glance, a wonder. Closer inspection shows shadowy figures shivering at the edges in the dark, left out. Whatever figures were once painted there are covered now by a soft, porous mold that peels away easily but seems endless.

If the keeper of this painting ever refuses to share food, they find one of their digits slowly becomes frostbitten, but the person to whom they refused succor begins to turn in that same time to snow, their flesh giving way to separating crystals.

## Starburst Veil

This sienna veil is fringed with bronze stars, each bearing an opaline heart. The cloth itself is thick and soft, falling in luxurious folds.

Anyone other than the wearer who attempts to lift the veil to see their face is instead blinded by a dozen brilliant starbursts of colorful light which continue to explode painfully in their mind until the veil is dropped once more.

## Mooniron Mortar and Pestle

This mortar and pestle are made from bluish granite, though cracks in the mortar have been filled with iron polished smooth. In moonlight, the pestle is twice as heavy but seems capable of grinding anything.

When used to prepare herbs, the keeper of this culinary tool finds that their entire prep work flows fast and smooth as if nothing can go wrong. Any meal eaten with crushed ingredients from this mortar and pestle taste distincly metallic, but time seems to pass 3/4 as fast for the eaters til their next meal.

## The Deck of Nails

This small box is carved of Pentolan marble in the shape of a box of playing cards common to Pentola. When opened, all nearby light dims until the lid is closed again. Inside, a deck of 40 plain linen cards, a handful of them marked with pips eerily reminiscent of fingernails.

The bearer of this box may pull their fingernails and place them upon a blank card; each fingernail so placed grants one minute of perfect health, near immortality, to the bearer. A Fingernail so used never grows back.

## The Comrade's Bowl

This shallow olive bowl is entirely unremarkable save for the golden spear head hammered into its belly and the fact that it is always and forever damp.

If the keeper of this bowl places their own food into the bowl, they find that it is incredibly nutritious and tasty, feeding half-a-gross of other people with a single morsel. The keeper of the bowl, however, gains no nourishment from that or any meal for three days.

## Tireless Handtruck

This simple wooden handtruck has a too-thin iron lever at the bottom but nevertheless is capable of bearing any load lifted upon it.

When used to transport anything, the user of this handtruck finds that they are tireless, able to work for hours without feeling any strain, though observers note that they do show it, nonetheless. When the user lays down to sleep, they remain in a deep slumber for as twice as many hours as they used the handtruck.

## Moonbattle Brush

This stiff brush has tiny bristles of iron wire and is of the same sort used to clean armor after battle. On the bristles grows a pale mint mold which tastes of freshly cut lime.

When used to polish any metal clean, it makes the object impossibly reflective, returning an order of magnitude more light than is shone upon it until the next time it is in moonlight.

## Rod of the Oathkeeper

This thick marble rod is wrapped in well-oiled orchid-pink drakeleather and has three long silk ribbons dangling from the thinner end, each depicting a gracious and magnanimous captain being admired by their warriors.

When the bearer of this rod touches it to the lips of someone who fights for them, that person is imbued with incredible alacrity so long as they respect and admire the bearer. If they are hostile, the bearer instead is frozen in place, unable to move for one minute.

## Pitcher of the Fruit Vendor's Morn

This pitcher is rimmed with Pentolan marble and has dozens of tiny iron charms pressed into it, each shaped like a tiny fruit stand.

When a single slice of fruit is placed into it along with any drinkable liquid, the liquid is infused with the flavor of that fruit as if a full day had passed. Anyone who consumes a drink poured from this pitcher feels as if they've just awoken from a restful night's sleep.

## The Would-Be Spiron

This ash crossbow has a stave of pentolan marble carved with a relief of the Pentolan skyline, spires rising from the canals below. Despite its impossible construction, the crossbow is relatively easy to cock, the marble bending mysteriously.

The bearer of this crossbow finds themselves exceptionally hungry for renown and lucre alike; while using it in the service of those goals, they find that their aim is unerring, but they seem incapable of calculating risks.
