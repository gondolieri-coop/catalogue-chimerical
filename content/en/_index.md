    description: "Pentola is a high fantasy game where you play citizens embroiled in intrigue and adventure in a bronze age megalopolis, and where your choices and beliefs shape reality. In Pentola, there is no distinction between artisinal work and magic; so this site contains a multitude of items crafted by artisans in the city for use in any game."

    description: "We are a small group of tabletop game designers forming a cooperative  that seeks to change the industry by proving out a new model which remunerates everyone involved equitably and transparently for their labor, funds the creation of art and games, and reinvests in the community both directly (supporting projects and creators, buying equipment and software, etc) and indirectly (helping keep creators housed/fed through hard times, seeding funds for creative endeavors, establishing re-usable contracts and templates). Our members are international as is the scope of our impact."
