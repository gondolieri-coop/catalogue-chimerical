## Bear's Fury Piercings

This pair of dermal piercings are in the shape of roaring bear's heads, carved of ironoak and thinly coated with a pale blue-gray mold in the crevices.

While worn in the flesh, whichever muscles the piercings were inserted into swell in size, as if perfected by years of training. The blue mold can be scraped and devoured to spread this effect throughout the body for ten minutes, but makes the imbiber violently ill for an hour afterward.
