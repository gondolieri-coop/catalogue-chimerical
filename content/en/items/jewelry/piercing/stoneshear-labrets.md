## Stoneshear Labrets

These lip piercings are a small pair of kopis, their protruding handles shaped like Pentolan Pikes, their blades made of brightly polished iron. Worn, the handles protrude above the lips, the blades rest against the teeth.

Recovered from the body of a would-be heretic assassin who used them, I confirmed the effects afterward myself under appropriate conditions: pulled loose from the wearer, each kopis grows to full size in a moment, capable of cutting through even stone as if it were mere air. Until replaced, the wearer's mouth bleeds profusely.
