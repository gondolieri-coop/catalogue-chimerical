## Avaricious Earrings

A fan of etched Pentolan face cards sway from these silver earrings, always catching the light.

Donated by a Spire Basilisco guest of our Farewell Ward who was willing to attest to the work's
effects via the Truthing dweomer. The wearer can hear even the softest whisper nearby, so long
as it is about wealth. Plans to acquire or secure wealth are heard especially clearly.
