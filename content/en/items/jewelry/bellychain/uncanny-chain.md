## Uncanny Chain

This delicate porcelain chain wraps around the waist and carries disc of bronze inlaid with
opaline scrollwork of duelling warriors.

Purchased at a gladiator auction, I discovered this work's effects and confirmed them via
exhaustive experimentation: when the wearer touches the disc, they can focus on a single
opponent and know their next move a split second before it begins.

I wonder if the eventual owner of this chain ever thought to use it the way we did in those long
hours in the shade of your garden.
