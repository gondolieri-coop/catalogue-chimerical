## Desire's Bloom

This thin chain is made of alternating links of gold and silver and features a bloody daffodil
wrought from rose gold.

A gift from a merchant seeking enlightenment, the effect confirmed via the Truthing dweomer.
When worn around the waist, the daffodil blooms and shrinks in accordance with the covetous
nature of the people nearby. If the daffodil blooms fully, the wearer knows the specifics of
everyone's covetous thoughts.
