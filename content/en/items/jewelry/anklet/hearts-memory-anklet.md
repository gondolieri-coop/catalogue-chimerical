## Heart's Memory Anklet

This anklet is merely made of rosemary with the petals gilded silver, the stems gold. The clasp is a pair of bronze hands reaching out for one another.

Donated by an elderly man with wet eyes, I confirmed the claims about the work's effect to my satisfaction: the wearer is incapable of turning their thoughts far from loved ones, memories rising unbidden at all times. When attempting to recall a particular memory, it comes vibrantly and fully, clear as if it was moments ago.
