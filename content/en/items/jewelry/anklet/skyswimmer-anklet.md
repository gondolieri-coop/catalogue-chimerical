## Skyswimmer Anklet

This anklet is made of a bronze arrowhead marked with a bespiked rune and threaded with thin
twisted iron wire.

Donated anonymously, I discovered and documented this work's effects via extensive and somewhat
fortunate experimentation. Beasts of the air seem to hate and fear the wearer, fleeing or
attacking them nigh universally. If the wearer's blood touches the rune, they find the air
becomes thick as water for them, though they breathe without difficulty. This lasts until their
blood dries.
