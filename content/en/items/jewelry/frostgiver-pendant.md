## Frostgiver Pendant

This lapis lazuli pendant is miraculously strung not with wire but with thin ironoak, mysteriously supple whilst held. The engraving on the pendant shows a woman offering her cloak while snow falls thick.

Anyone whom the wearer lends clothing to finds that they are utterly immune to the cold. Until the item is returned, the pendant wearer frosts everything they touch, though their extremeties slowly become frostbitten over the next several days unless the item is returned or they give away something else.
