## Winter's Edge

This pin features a miniature gold-bladed khopesh with a pale lavender silk tassle dangling from it.

Purchased at a gladiator auction after witnessing the work's effects, I confirmed them myself: while worn, the wearer's breath is always frost-clouded. They are unaffected by cold and any wound they inflict crystallizes immediately.
