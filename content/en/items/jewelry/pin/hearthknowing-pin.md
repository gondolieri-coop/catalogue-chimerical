## Hearthknowing Pin

This thick pin is carved from Pentolan marble and decorated with licking flames, proportions
pleasantly exaggerated. Picking it up elicits a powerful wave of heat to shoot through the body.

Donated by a drakerider seeking enlightenment, I was able to confirm the effects of this work
via simple experimentation: the wearer can take this pin off and touch it to any flame. While
worn, they can sense the presence of anyone who can see those flames.
