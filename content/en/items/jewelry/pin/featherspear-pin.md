## Featherspear Pin

This ash-shafted pin features a spearhead carved from jade in a shape suggestive of a quill
feather; whatever it is pinned through slowly grows a pale pink-gray mold.

This work was deposited anonymously at our archway, I discovered the effect by simple
experimentation: whatever material this pin pierces becomes weightless as the mold grows over
it, though it seems not to harm the material.
