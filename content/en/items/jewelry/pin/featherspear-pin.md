## Featherspear Pin

This ash-shafted pin features a spearhead carved from jade in the shape of a quill feather; Whatever it is pinned through slowly grows a pale pink-gray mold.

Whatever material this pin pierces becomes weightless as the mold grows over it, though it seems not to harm the material.
