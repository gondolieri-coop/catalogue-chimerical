## Telling Tongue Pin

This bronze pin is shaped like an absurdly proportioned tongue, narrowing to a needle point. The
back of the tongue features a simple ring through which a knotted tassle of multicolored silk
has been threaded.

Purchased from a second-hand shop without any accompanying notes, this work's effects were
discovered purely via experimentation: while worn, the wearer has an exceptional sense of taste,
enabling the discernment of flavor from across the room. If the pin is dipped into something and
then licked, the bearer uncannily knows precisely what they are tasting, so long as they have
tasted it before.
