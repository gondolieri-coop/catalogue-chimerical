## Roseblood Ring

This thick copper ring is studded with tiny mageglass daggers, the sharp facets stained red.

A personal gift from a local artisan seeking enlightenment who attested to the work's effects via Truthing dweomer. While worn, the wearer can smell the passion of anyone close like crushed roses; the strength of the scent is commensurate with the passion felt. Any blood spilled by the ring contains memories of the victim's most passionate moments. The interview with the artisan is available on request.
