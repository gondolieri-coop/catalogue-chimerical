## Moonberry Ring

This thick ring is made of smoothly polished granite and topped with an ironoak relief of the watchful moon at its zenith over a berry bush. It smells of crushed raspberries.

The bearer of this ring is compelled to kiss it and to seek out fruits to satisfy their newfound sweet tooth; every day that circumstances keep them from eating such fruit they become bitterly selfish. All tastes become extraordinarily more potent, their tongue an order of magnitude more sensitive.
