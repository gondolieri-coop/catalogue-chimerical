## Ring Celestial Lumen

This silver and copper wire ring is set with a large cracked and dimpled opal. In sunlight, the
opal slowly shrinks, the setting shrinking with it; in moonlight, it expands.

Donated anonymously and without notes, I discovered and verified this work's effects via
experimentation. When the wearer touches the opal to something, it dissolves and whatever was
touched takes on an opaline sheen; until the next moonrise, the effect of sun/moon light is also
transferred.
