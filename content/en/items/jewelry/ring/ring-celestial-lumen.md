## Ring Celestial Lumen

This silver and copper wire ring is set with a large cracked and dimpled opal. In sunlight, the opal slowly shrinks, the setting shrinking with it; in moonlight, it expands.

When the wearer touches the opal to something, it dissolves and whatever was touched takes on an opaline sheen; until the next moonrise, the effect of sun/moon light is also transferred.
