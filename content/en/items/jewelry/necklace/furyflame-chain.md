## Furyflame Chain

This thick gold chain is made of loops evocative of twisted flame; the clasp is set in porcelain textured and glazed like a drop of boiling water.

The necklace is always both warm and wet to the touch; when worn, the anger of those nearby is reportedly burned up by the necklace, one person per link. On command, the wearer can unleash the stored anger in a burst of hot air from their own lips.
