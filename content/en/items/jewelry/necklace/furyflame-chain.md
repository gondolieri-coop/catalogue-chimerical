## Furyflame Chain

This thick gold chain is made of thirty-six loops evocative of twisted flame; the clasp is set
in porcelain textured and glazed like a drop of boiling water. Always both warm and wet to the
touch.

Purchased from a retired gladiator who attested to the work's effect via the Truthing dweomer:
when worn, the anger of those nearby is burned up by the necklace, one person per link. On
command, the wearer can unleash the stored anger in a burst of hot air from their own lips.
