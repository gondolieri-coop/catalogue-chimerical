## Infernally Bound Chain

This thin silver chain has seven polished iron links strewn through it. When near a fire, it fills the air with the smell of heady incense smoke.

The wearer is immune to any and all affects of heat, magical or mundane. For every minute they expose themselves to heat which would cause them harm, one of the iron links will heat to a white glow, cooling one after another each hour. If all seven become hot enough to glow, the wearer is immediately immolated.
