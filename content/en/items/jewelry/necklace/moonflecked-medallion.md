## Moonflecked Medallion

This simple silver chain holds an ironoak disk sanded impossibly smooth. In moonlight, it becomes reflective.

The wearer of this medallion can sense the presense of everyone not lit by the moon nearby. While concentrating, the wearer can see the face of anyone lit by moonlight nearby.
