## Marblefalcon Bracelet

This thick tin bracelet is etched with a screaming Pentolan falcon, its gaping beak made of cracked Pentolan marble; held aloft, shadows nearby flicker as if something races across them.

When the wearer of this bracelet taps it against stone the depicted falcon's beak cracks thunderously and the bird tears itself free of the tapped stone, taking flight and obeying the wearer as if trained. After an hour, the stone falcon collapses lifelessly.
