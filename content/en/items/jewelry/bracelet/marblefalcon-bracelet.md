## Marblefalcon Bracelet

This thick tin bracelet is etched with a screaming Pentolan falcon, its gaping beak made of
cracked Pentolan marble; held aloft, shadows nearby flicker as if something races across them.

Donated by a Spire Basilisco agent who demonstrated its effect on request. When the wearer of
this bracelet taps it against stone the depicted falcon's beak cracks thunderously and the bird
tears itself free of the tapped stone, taking flight and obeying the wearer as if trained. After
an hour, the stone falcon collapses lifelessly.
