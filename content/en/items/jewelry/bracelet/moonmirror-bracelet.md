## Moonmirror Bracelet

This yellow silk bracelet holds a plain circle of bronze; on the reverse, a furry violet mold
grows, rubbing off easily. The face is dull, reflecting nothing except in moonlight, when
everything is reflected like a perfect mirror.

Purchased without notes at auction, I discovered this work's effect quite on accident and
confirmed it meticulously. Any time something stained with the mold from this bracelet is
reflected on the bracelet's face it triples in size and stays that way until touched by
sunlight.
