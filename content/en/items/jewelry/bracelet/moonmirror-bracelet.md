## Moonmirror Bracelet

This yellow silk bracelet holds a plain circle of bronze; on the reverse, a furry violet mold grows, rubbing off easily. The face is dull, reflecting nothing except in moonlight, when everything is reflected like a perfect mirror.

Any time something stained with the mold from this bracelet is reflected on the bracelet's face it triples in size and stays that way until touched by sunlight.
