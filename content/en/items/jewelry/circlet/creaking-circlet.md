## Creaking Circlet

This twisted willow circlet bears a stylized geometric ironoak wrought from iron, the willow dyed blotchily red with old blood.

Anything the wearer touches the ironoak to rapidly grows in side with audible creaking, though thorns grow from the willow into their head the longer they stay in contact and do not retract until fully removed.
