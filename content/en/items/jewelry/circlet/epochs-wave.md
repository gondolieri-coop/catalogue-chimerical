## Epoch's Wave

This thin copper circlet is mounted with a blue-glazed porcelain disk depicted rippling waves. The image is always wet to the touch.

Anyone wearing this circlet does not age so long as they are wet by rain or groundwater. If the wearer wets their hand on the disk and touches someone with that hand, they can freely transfer days of their life to and from the target.
