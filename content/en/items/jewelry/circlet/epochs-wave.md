## Epoch's Wave

This thin copper circlet is mounted with a blue-glazed porcelain disk depicted rippling stylized
waves. The image is always wet to the touch.

Donated by a Pentolan guest in our Farewell Ward, she attested to this work's effects via the
Truthing dweomer: anyone wearing this circlet does not age so long as they are wet by rain or
groundwater. If the wearer wets their hand on the disk and touches someone with that hand, they
can freely transfer days of their life to and from the target. I suspect that her use of this
work is what brought her to our Farewell Ward, but she was disinclined to answer me.
