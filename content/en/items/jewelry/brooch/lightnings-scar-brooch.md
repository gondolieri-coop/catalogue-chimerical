## Lightning's Scar Brooch

This tin brooch is shaped like a lightning-struck tree, with a dozen forks of lightning made from carefully inlaid porcelain, some of them broken.

When the wearer nears a tree devastated by lightning, they are drawn to it. Placing a hand upon the charred husk transfers some of the heat of the strike to the wearer, searing their hand. The full impact of all lightning strikes thus absorbed will be released if any fork of porcelain lightning is ever broken.
