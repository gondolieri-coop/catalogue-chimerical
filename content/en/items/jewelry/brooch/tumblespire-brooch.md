## Tumblespire Brooch

A porcelain clasp for cloaks with small iron charms laid into it depicting one of the cities spires in various states of collapse. This spire does not seem to exist.

This brooch was recovered from a hanged thief who sought to use it to pull down our embassy in this debaucherous place. Under... questioning, he admitted he had been instructed to slide the pin into the mortar of a central pillar, which would collapse the building after three cycles of the moon.
