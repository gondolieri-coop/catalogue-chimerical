## Cobbler's Foe

This bronze brooch is engraved with a pair of sandals, their straps broken and trailing. They hum excitedly when not in motion.

Donated by a drakerider seeking enlightenment who claimed to have no use for it, I was able to validate their report on this work's effects: when barefoot, the wearer's walking speed doubles; shoed, it is halved.
