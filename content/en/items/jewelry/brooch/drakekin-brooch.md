## Drakekin Brooch

This brooch is made of ironoak with a simple silver pin; carved into the face of the brooch is a pair of nuzzling drakes, one much larger, both with identical spikes. On the back, a simple silver rune.

While worn, the imagery animates in slow motion; any drakes older than the wearer treat them as offspring; any younger drakes treat the wearer as a parent. The effect seems to wear off slowly unless the brooch is held by another, in which case it immediately transfers.
