## Drakekin Brooch

This brooch is made of ironoak with a simple silver pin; carved into the face of the brooch is a
pair of nuzzling drakes, one much larger, both with identical spikes. On the back, a simple
silver rune.

Discovered in the belongings of a Pentolan guest of the Farewell Ward, I discovered this effect
via meticulous experimentation. While worn, the imagery animates in slow motion; any drakes
older than the wearer treat them as offspring, younger drakes treat the wearer as a parent. The
effect seems to wear off slowly unless the brooch is held by another, in which case it
immediately transfers.
