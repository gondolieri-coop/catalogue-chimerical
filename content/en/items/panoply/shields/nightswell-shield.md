## Nightswell Shield

This drakeleather faced shield is painted sloppily with pitch, clean only where a symbol of the moon made from porcelain is sewn just above the boss. Moonlight pulses when it falls upon the shield's face.

When held aloft in moonlight, this shield doubles in size with a flick of the wrist; shrinking again if the motion is repeated or the moonlight no longer falls upon it.
