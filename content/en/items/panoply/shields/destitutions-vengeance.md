## Destitution's Vengeance

This mahogany hourglass shield is carved with images of a preposterously wealthy warrior being
overwhelmed and beaten to death by unarmored folk armed only with rough-hewn turquoise stones
sewn into the surface.

This work was donated by an eyeless old enlightened marine who confirmed the effects via the
Truthing dweomer. Whenever the bearer of this shield faces an enemy with greater wealth or
standing their eyes slowly turn to turquoises over the course of a minute; when the
transformation is complete, they become something like a battle spirit, powerful and deadly, and
cannot stop until they kill their foe; when they do, the turquoise eyes fall out and their own
grow back slowly over the course of a day.
