## Destitution's Vengeance

This mahogany hourglass shield is carved with images of a ridiculously wealthy warrior being overwhelmed and beaten to death by unarmored folk armed only with rough-hewn turquoise stones sewn into the surface.

Whenever the bearer of this shield faces an enemy with greater wealth or standing their eyes slowly turn to turquoises over the course of a minute; when the transformation is complete, they become something like a battle spirit, powerful and deadly, and cannot stop until they kill their foe; when they do, the turquoise eyes fall out and their own grow back slowly over the course of a day.
