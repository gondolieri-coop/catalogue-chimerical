## Lunar Hunger Shield

This hourglass shield of stout drakeleather is painted with pitch and features an iron moon set
into each half, both growing a pale purple mold that furs the hammered craters.

The seller's claim about this work's primary effect was verified by way of the Truthing dweomer:
when the bearer of this shield is fighting for something they *want*, the mold thickens and
spreads, providing additional protection. I was able to separately (if unpleasantly) confirm
that the mold, if scraped and infused into a concoction, induces visions of the bearer's deepest
desires.

It probably does not surprise you to know that the last several times I drank this concoction it
showed me only a home life where you and I grew old together in some nameless little burb of
the city we fell for each other in.
