## Lunar Hunger Shield

This hourglass shield of stout drakeleather is painted with pitch and features an iron moon set into each half, both growing a pale purple mold that furs the hammered craters.

When the bearer of this shield is fighting for something they *want*, the mold thickens and spreads, providing additional protection. The mold, if scraped and infused into a concoction, induces visions of the bearer's deepest desires.
