## Silver Rampart

This bronze tower shield is inlaid with silver depicting a fortress wall bristling with iron spear points and raining tiny iron tipped arrows down and out. The bottom of the shield features two stout spikes.

This work's veracity was confirmed by the Gondolieri who sold it to me and confirmed via experimentation. When the bearer of this shield slams this shield into the ground and lets go a terrible thunder roars from the earth as the shield becomes fixed in place and behind it a twenty yard cube earthwork erupts forth, lifting all upon it. It lasts until the bearer reclaims the shield from the fortification wall or dies.
