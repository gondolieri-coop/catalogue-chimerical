## Companionsong Shield

This hourglass shield of woven reeds features a polished iron bell set into the top half while the bottom half's reeds are pierced by dozens of tiny iron runes commonly understood in Pentola to signify comradery, fortitude, courage, and sacrifice.

This work was purchased from a gladiator who demonstrated its use in exchange for temporary patronage. When the bearer of this shield strikes the bell it emits a ringing paean louder than a lightning strike which fills allies with ardour that lasts for ten minutes; one of the remaining charms on the bottom half rusts away.
