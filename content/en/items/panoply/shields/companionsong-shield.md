## Companionsong Shield

This hourglass shield of woven reeds features a polished iron bell set into the top half while the bottom half's reeds are pierced by tiny iron runes of comradery, fortitude, courage, and sacrifice.

When the bearer of this shield strikes the bell it emits a ringing paean louder than a lightning strike which fills allies with ardour that lasts for ten minutes; one of the remaining charms on the bottom half rusts away.
