## Lightkeeper Shield

This siege pavis is a relic of older days, out of fashion even by Pentolan standards. It is constructed of ironoak boards with a lavish golden lantern carefully inlaid upon its face, always bright.

My research has shown that this shield absorbs some amount of all the light directed at it and, if tapped hard against the ground, will unleash this stored light in a cone before it from the lantern's golden flame.
