## Bellylaugh Shield

This shield features concentric rings of Pentolan marble and ridged bronze hammered into the shape of dozens of laughing and drinking folk. On close inspection, their teeth are tiny pieces of inlaid iron.

I confirmed this work's effect by way of the Truthing dweomer on a witness provided by the seller: if the bearer of this shield is made to laugh hard enough to hurt, the teeth of one of the images on the shield disappears and the person who made the bearer laugh is flooded with energy as all hunger, thirst, ache, and exhaustion fade away.
