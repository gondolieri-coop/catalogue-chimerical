## Uncrafting Shield

This heavy tower shield is a solid piece of Pentolan marble, plain and smooth save for a dozen
veins of iron laid into it and a half dozen more rusted to empty channels.

I regret to report that this donated work's effect was only discovered accidentally and
destructively. If this shield is struck with magic of any sort, it is absorbed entirely,
releasing a tephratic burst of energy violently back towards the source and one more vein of
iron rusts away. For safety reasons (and to preserve the remaining work) I have not confirmed
the effect via experimentation.
