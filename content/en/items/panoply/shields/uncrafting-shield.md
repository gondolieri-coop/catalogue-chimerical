## Uncrafting Shield

This heavy tower shield is a solid piece of Pentolan marble, plain and smooth save for a dozen veins of iron laid into it and a half dozen more rusted to empty channels.

If this shield is struck with magic of any sort, it is absorbed entirely, releasing a tephratic burst of energy violently back towards the source and one more vein of iron rusts away.
