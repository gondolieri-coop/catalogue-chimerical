## Lifegrove Shield

This tower shield is made of ironoak carved with a grove of cedar trees, their roots reaching down into a blue-gray mold that furs the bottom quarter of the face.

If the bearer of this shield scrapes some of the mold into the mouth of an injured comrade, their wounds seal as if time reversed itself in their flesh, though the bearer's bones creak as they age a year for each injury so undone.
