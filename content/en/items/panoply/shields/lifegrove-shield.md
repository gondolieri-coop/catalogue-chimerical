## Lifegrove Shield

This tower shield is made of ironoak carved with a grove of cedar trees, their roots reaching
down into a blue-gray mold that furs the bottom quarter of the face.

Purchased at auction, the claim for this work was verified by a local apothecary who had used it
in the past. If the bearer of this shield scrapes some of the mold into the mouth of an injured
comrade, their wounds seal as if time reversed itself in their flesh, though the bearer's bones
creak as they age a year for each injury so undone. As backwards as Pentolan medicine is, this
work came at an enormously steep cost; we might think they would invest more in their education
but, of course, they prefer to fall back on the Craft they only half understand.

It is now obvious to me what you knew when we met; that medicine alone is too slow to help
everyone, and we should revel in the wonder of art that heals.
