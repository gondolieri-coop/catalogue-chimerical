## Moonshade Buckler

This thin buckler is faced with a sheet of Pentolan marble etched like the surface of the moon; dangling from the rim are tiny iron shafts of stylized moonbeams.

The bearer can remove any of the charms; for the next ten minutes, the moon's light refuses to shine near that charm as it rapidly rusts to nothing.
