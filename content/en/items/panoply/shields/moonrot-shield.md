## Moonrot Shield

This tin-covered shield is embossed with a garden dying beneath the light of the moon, whose rays are made of inlaid silver. The edge of the shield is covered in apparently rotting dark green silk.

Extensive experimentation on this donated work finally revealed that when the bearer of this shield touches it to a plant in moonlight, that plant and everything its roots touch begins to wither, further rotting the silk cover.
