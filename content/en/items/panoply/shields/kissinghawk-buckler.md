## Kissinghawk Buckler

This stout bronze buckler's boss is of ironoak carved as a falconer nuzzling their raptor;
around the outside edge opaline scrollwork details a Pentolan poem about the faith and trust
between them.

The falconer who donated this work demonstrated that if the bearer kisses the buckler's boss a
piercing cry fills the air as the nearest hawk comes to settle on the shield, calm and
interested in the bearer. I was able to confirm the effect during further experimentation,
though the wait for a hawk to arrive can feel interminable.
