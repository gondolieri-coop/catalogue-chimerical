## Kissinghawk Buckler

This stout bronze buckler's boss is of ironoak carved as a falconer nuzzling their raptor; around the outside edge opaline scrollwork details a Pentolan poem about the faith and trust between them.

If the bearer kisses the buckler's boss a piercing cry fills the air as the nearest hawk comes to settle on the shield, calm and interested in the bearer.
