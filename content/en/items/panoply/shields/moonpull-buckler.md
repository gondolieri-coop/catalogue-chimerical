## Moonpull Buckler

This small willow shield is sheathed in tin polished mirror-smooth. The boss itself is made of delicate porcelain in the shape of the moon, marring the otherwise perfectly reflective surface of the shield.

Any damage to this shield quickly reverts under direct moonlight, returning to the perfectly polished and smooth state in mere moments. If the porcelain of the boss is ever cracked, the object or person who broke it is yanked, hard, a dozen feet towards the moon, wherever it currently is.
