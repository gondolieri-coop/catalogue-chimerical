## Clasping Buckler

This buckler is made of willow woven like loosely clasped hands encircling the carnelian set in its bronze boss; from the handle dangles a long crimson silk tassle.

The seller of this work demonstrated to my satisfaction that if the bearer holds the hand of another person they are able to share thoughts wordlessly, accurately, and instantaneously. While they do so, the hands on the buckler tighten, pulling the edges inward.
