## Clasping Buckler

This buckler is made of willow woven like loosely clasped hands encircling the carnelian set in
its bronze boss; from the handle dangles a long crimson silk tassle.

The seller of this work demonstrated to my satisfaction that if the bearer holds the hand of
another person they are able to share thoughts wordlessly, accurately, and instantaneously.
While they do so, the hands on the buckler tighten, pulling the edges inward.

Left unsaid here are the many times you and I used this buckler to share the words we could not
speak aloud in the palace. Though in truth, sometimes, I just wanted to hold your hand in mine.
