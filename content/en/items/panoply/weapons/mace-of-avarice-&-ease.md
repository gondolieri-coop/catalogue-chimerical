## Mace of Avarice & Ease

This small solid silver mace is perpetually a little damp. Each of the seven flanges are etched with images of prosperity and good fortune; a lawyer, thief, warrior, painter, merchant, chef, and musician.

Anyone struck by this mace becomes greedy, exponentially more motivated by the promise of wealth and recognition. The bearer themself is inured to any such impulses for as long as they hold the mace.
