## Kinkeep Crossbow

This massive crossbow's heavy trigger lever is made from ornately forged iron in the shape of a family of artisans showing each other their works; from the butt dangles a pale yellow silk tassel.

Any bolt fired from this weapon made by a loved one impacts twice as hard and rips through magic as if it wasn't there; any other bolt impacts half as hard as normal and any magic inherent to it is nullified.
