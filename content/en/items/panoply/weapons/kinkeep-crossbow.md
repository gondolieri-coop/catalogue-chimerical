## Kinkeep Crossbow

This massive crossbow's heavy trigger lever is made from ornately forged iron in the shape of a
family of artisans showing each other their works; from the butt dangles a pale yellow silk
tassel.

While I was unable to verify the seller's claims myself, I was able to contract with some locals
and the claim proved true: any bolt fired from this weapon made by a loved one impacts twice as
hard and rips through magic as if it wasn't there; any other bolt impacts half as hard as normal
and any magic inherent to it is nullified. Sentimental, but possibly of great value to any
family with a fletcher (if they can stomache the imagery).
