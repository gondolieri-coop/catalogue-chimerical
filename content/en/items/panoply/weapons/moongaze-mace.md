## Moongaze Mace

This stone-headed mace is carved in a flanged spiral, hafted on a long piece of ash. Hammered
into the eye is a small silver moon which hums in darkness.

While I was skeptical of the detailed notes detailing this work by the donar, they bore out:
when bearer of this mace strikes with it in moonlight and calls out to the moon, they draw its
attention as a bolt of burning moonlight sears the spot they struck; until the moon sets,
however, its gaze does not leave the bearer. Pentolans report this as uncomfortable, but they
are quite superstitious.
