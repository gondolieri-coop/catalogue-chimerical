## Moongaze Mace

This stone-headed mace is carved in a flanged spiral, hafted on a long piece of ash. Hammered into the eye is a small silver moon which hums in darkness.

When bearer of this mace strikes with it in moonlight and calls out to the moon, they draw its attention as a bolt of burning moonlight sears the spot they struck; until the moon sets, however, its gaze does not leave the bearer.
