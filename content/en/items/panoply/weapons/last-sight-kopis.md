## Last Sight Kopis

This bronze kopis is wickedly sharp, chipped and very slightly bent, the bronze splashed with dried blood. The hilt is decorated with dozens of platinum eyes shut tight.

When the blade is dipped in a being's blood the eyes open wide, revealing golden orbs, and the bearer sees the moments leading to the injury from the being's perspective; if the **bearer** spilled the blood, they instead see the being's most happiest memory from their perspective.
