## Rod of the Oathkeeper

This thick marble rod is wrapped in well-oiled orchid-pink drakeleather and has three long silk ribbons dangling from the thinner end, each depicting a gracious and magnanimous captain being admired by their warriors.

When the bearer of this rod touches it to the lips of someone who fights for them, that person is imbued with incredible alacrity so long as they respect and admire the bearer. If they are hostile, the bearer instead is frozen in place, unable to move for one minute.
