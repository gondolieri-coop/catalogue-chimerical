## Furytamer

This draketooh's shaped halberd's head is held to the stave with golden pins and is etched with a snarling drake engulfed in roaring flames.

Purchased from the surviving family member of a "retired" Gondolieri, I validated this seller's claims during an expedition into the Undercity. When presented before any hostile beast it gives the creature pause and redirects their ire toward whatever the halberd is pointed at next.
