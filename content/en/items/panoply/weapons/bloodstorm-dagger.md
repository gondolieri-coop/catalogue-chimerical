## Bloodstorm Dagger

This thin forked throwing dagger is made from surprisingly sturdy porcelain in the shape of a tall thin tree burning from a lightning strike that split its trunk. Its handle is wrapped in pale silk.

Purchased from the artisan who made it, they were willing to testify to its effect under a Truthing dweomer. When the bearer of this throwing dagger throws it into a surface marked with their own blood causes the blade to become a conduit for a fearsome lightning strike, forking one of the split halves of the tree again. The artisan declined to explain their reasoning for creating it, stating only "It speaks for itself."
