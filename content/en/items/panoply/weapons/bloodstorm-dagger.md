## Bloodstorm Dagger

This thin forked throwing dagger is made from surprisingly sturdy porcelain in the shape of a tall thin tree burning from a lightning strike that split its trunk. Its handle is wrapped in pale silk.

The bearer of this throwing dagger who throws it into a surface marked with their own blood causes the blade to become a conduit for a fearsome lightning strike, forking one of the split halves of the tree again.
