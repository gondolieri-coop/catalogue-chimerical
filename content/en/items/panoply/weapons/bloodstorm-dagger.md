## Bloodstorm Dagger

This thin forked throwing dagger is made from surprisingly sturdy porcelain in the shape of a
tall thin tree burning from a lightning strike that split its trunk. Its handle is wrapped in
pale silk.

Purchased from the artisan who made it, they were willing to testify to its effect under a
Truthing dweomer. When the bearer of this throwing dagger throws it into a surface marked with
their own blood causes the blade to become a conduit for a fearsome lightning strike, forking
one of the split halves of the tree again. The artisan declined to explain their reasoning for
creating it, stating only "It speaks for itself."

This perplexed me so much! It took me years to understand art without consulting the creator's
intent. What a myopic view I held on the work! I am so grateful you helped me see a more
beautiful truth.
