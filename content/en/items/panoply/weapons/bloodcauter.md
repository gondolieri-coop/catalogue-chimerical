## Bloodcauter

This short bronze sword features a polished piece of mageglass set into its guard, always uncomfortably warm to the touch.

If the bearer of this blade cuts themself and mixes their spilling blood with the wound of another, the wound burns closed safely, if painfully; until the next sunrise, however, the bearer's own bleeding will not even slow.
