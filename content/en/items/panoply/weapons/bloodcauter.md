## Bloodcauter

This short bronze sword features a polished piece of mageglass set into its guard, always uncomfortably warm to the touch.

I found good opportunity to test this work's effect when a woman injured in one of Pentola's many streetfights came to us for succor; if the bearer of this blade cuts themself and mixes their spilling blood with the wound of another, the wound burns closed safely, if painfully; until the next sunrise, however, the bearer's own bleeding will not even slow. Luckily, it does not take a _large_ cut of the wielder to manifest the effect. Another mark of Pentola's rank ignorance of medicine and the Great Treatises.
