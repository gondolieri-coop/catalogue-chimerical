## Bloodcauter

This short bronze sword features a polished piece of mageglass set into its guard, always
uncomfortably warm to the touch.

I found good opportunity to test this work's effect when a woman injured in one of Pentola's
many streetfights came to us for succor; if the bearer of this blade cuts themself and mixes
their spilling blood with the wound of another, the wound burns closed safely, if painfully;
until the next sunrise, however, the bearer's own bleeding will not even slow. Luckily, it does
not take a _large_ cut of the wielder to manifest the effect. Another mark of Pentola's rank
ignorance of medicine and the Great Treatises.

I wonder how many lives my comrades could save if they could but prioritize helping people over
helping people the "right" way. Those long nights we spent during the Confectionary Conflict
soothing burns and comforting folk - did anyone complain that you used your songs to heal them?
No. Your voice was better medicine than any poultice I managed.
