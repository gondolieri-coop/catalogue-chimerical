## Inferno's Fury

This six yard long pike is tipped with a blade of porcelain shaped like a skyward-reaching flame. All other flames in its presence seem hungry and hateful, burning hot and smoky.

The bearer of this pike feels the destructive hunger of every flame near them while they hold it; if they give into this hunger, they can hear the whispers of the flames telling them how to hurt and harm anyone the flames perceive.
