## Inferno's Fury

This six yard long pike is tipped with a blade of porcelain shaped like a skyward-reaching
flame. All other flames in its presence seem somehow hungry and hateful, burning hot and smoky.

Purchased from a Spearspire auction, used in one of the sundry scuffles againt that militant
spire. Interview via Truth dweomer of the incarcerated former bearer indicated that the wielder
of this pike feels the destructive hunger of every flame near them while they hold it; if they
give into this hunger, they can hear the whispers of the flames telling them how to hurt and
harm anyone the flames perceive. A strange item to make, possibly authorless as the Pentolans do
not always fully intend their own works.

I think about this work often, still. How hurt was its author? How much pain did they feel that
they found their hands making such a thing? I hope you never know such turmoil.
