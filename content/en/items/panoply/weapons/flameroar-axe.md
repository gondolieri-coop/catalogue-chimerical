## Flameroar Axe

This socket-axe is hafted onto stout ironoak, the shaft a well-sanded and oiled octagon. The head itself is shaped like a rising flame, the bronze flashing in the light, the lines of the inner flame made of tiny runic ears.

When held aloft, the bearer may roar with the sound of a thousand infernos, overwhelming everyone nearby.
