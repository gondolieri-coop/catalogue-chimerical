## The Would-Be Spiron

This ash crossbow has a stave of pentolan marble carved with a relief of the Pentolan skyline, spires rising from the canals below. Despite its impossible construction, the crossbow is relatively easy to cock, the marble bending mysteriously.

The bearer of this crossbow finds themselves exceptionally hungry for renown and lucre alike; while using it in the service of those goals, they find that their aim is unerring, but they seem incapable of calculating risks.
