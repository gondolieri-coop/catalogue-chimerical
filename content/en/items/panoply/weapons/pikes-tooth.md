## Pike's Tooth

This bronze blade is thick, almost beautiful, a twisting three-pointed star that rises to a sharp point like a Pentolan Pike's bite, it's pommel a flat wooden disc with a strange rune burned into it.

Forged as a gift to a Gascon who died en route to the city, this weapon makes even a slow warrior fast, enabling them to stab with supernatural speed if they stand upon the waves.
