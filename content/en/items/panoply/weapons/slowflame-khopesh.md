## Slowflame Khopesh

This flimsy copper khopesh is utterly plain and cheap save for the extravagant iron edge welded to it which undulates like lapping flames up the curved weapon.

Brief experimentation with this work proved to me that to wield this blade is to fight sluggishly as if underwater; to strike with this blade is to burn through stone like butter.
