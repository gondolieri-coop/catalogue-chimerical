## Flameater

This jagged mageglass dagger's handle is sheathed in dimpled bronze rather than wrapped in the
usual silk. Held in a fire, the flame's colors shift to a dark purple, dimming the area as the
flames slowly starve.

I was able to verify the seller's claim of this work's primary effect myself: the bearer of this
dagger can feed flame, magical or mundane, to it and later imbue any dweomer of their own with
the stolen flame though the handle heats painfully while they do so. Unfortunately, we
discovered during replication that it must not be dropped while in the heated state, lest the
wielder be engulfed instead. The participant was healed and recompensed threefold for their
suffering, as the Great Treatise requires.
