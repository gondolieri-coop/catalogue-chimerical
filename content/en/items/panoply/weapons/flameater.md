## Flameater

This jagged mageglass dagger's handle is sheathed in dimpled bronze rather than wrapped in the usual silk. Held in a fire, the flame's colors shift to a dark purple, dimming the area as the flames slowly starve.

The bearer of this dagger can feed flame, magical or mundane, to it and later imbue any dweomer of their own with the stolen flame, though the handle heats painfully while they do so and must not be dropped, lest they be engulfed instead.
