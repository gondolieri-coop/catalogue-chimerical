## Fieldmaker Bow

This ironoak bow is strongly recurved and smells faintly of sumac. The horn tips are carved with images of rolling fields of plenty.

Any arrow deliberately loosed into the ground will snap the bowstring; however, so long as the arrow is not removed from the earth all things around it will grow heavy and thick unless tended by the archer.
