## Stormbreaker

This small bronze handaxe is capped with a lightning-shaped spike of polished iron. The haft is made from scorched olive wood. Picking it up brings forth a powerful smell of ozone.

When held aloft in a storm this axe draws the full fury of the skies upon itself; the bearer's body is immune to the destruction, which rapidly transfers from the weather into the weapon, affecting everything nearby.
