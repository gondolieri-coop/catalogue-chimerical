## Myopic Moplah

A broad-bladed sword with a widely curving tip, the small guard made of marble and the grip opaline, depicting a lavish villa above the sea.

Acquired from a warrior who was laid low in a street fight, struck from behind. Witnesses reported that she seemed wholly unaware of anyone and anything except for the person she had begun attacking, though the blade reportedly sheared through her target's blade, shield, and body alike.
