## Griffinweal

This handaxe's head is made of delicate pale green porcelain in the shape of a snarling griffin,
wings outstretched to either side, its body clad in scaled armor. It smells strongly of fresh
crushed mint.

Donated to us by the Skylion Spiron's nibling in thanks for saving their friend's life after
falling from a training griffin, its effect verified under the Truthing dweomer. The bearer of
this axe finds themselves the friend of any raptor or griffin they encounter; a griffin who
licks the axe head becomes bonded to it, willing to follow the bearer like kin.
