## Griffinweal

This handaxe's head is made of delicate pale green porcelain in the shape of a snarling griffin, wings outstretched to either side, its body clad in scaled armor. It smells strongly of fresh crushed mint.

The bearer of this axe finds themselves the friend of any raptor or griffin they encounter; a griffin who licks the axe head becomes bonded to it, willing to follow the bearer like kin.
