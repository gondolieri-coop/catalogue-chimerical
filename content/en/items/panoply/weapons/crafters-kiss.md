## Crafter's Kiss

This otherwise simple crossbow's handle is studded with tiny amethysts and agates in the form of kissing folk surrounded the swirling dust of the Violet Storm.

Any dweomer the bearer knows can be manifested through a bolt loaded into this crossbow, obviating the need for any other targeting or distance calculations.
