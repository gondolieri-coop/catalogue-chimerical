## Crafter's Kiss

This otherwise pleasingly simple crossbow's handle is studded with tiny amethysts and agates in
the form of kissing folk surrounded the swirling dust of the Violet Storm.

I was surprised to find that the donar's claims about this work proved out in experiments; any
dweomer the bearer knows can be manifested through a bolt loaded into this crossbow, obviating
the need for any other targeting or distance calculations in the dweomer's application.
