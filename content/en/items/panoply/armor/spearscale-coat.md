## Spearscale Coat

This coat of tiny bronze scales has several precious iron scales sewn into its chest in the image of a brilliant spearhead, the top scales stained red with blood that never cleans off.

While worn, this coat of scaled imbues the wearer with a powerful lust for glory and battle, filling their belly with fire. Their hand becomes quick to violence, their mind slow to think about anything else.
