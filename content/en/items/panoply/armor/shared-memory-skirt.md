## Shared Memory Skirt

This enamelled linen skirt depicts warriors facing outwards, swords drawn, each clasping hands with another. Every third panel of the skirt is made of thin Pentolan marble carved the same, except the warriors are looking at each other.

When worn, the air smells faintly of mint and pepper. The wearer may clasp hands with someone and both can see a shared memory as if it is reoccurring right now, but from the other's perspective.
