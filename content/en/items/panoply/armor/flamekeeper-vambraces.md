## Flamekeeper Vambraces

These puce drakeleather vambraces are tooled meticulously in the image of roiling flames, the heart of each of them embossed with bronze.

When worn, anything held in either hand shrinks to half its normal size in a flash of scorching light, returning to normal size when let go, but glowing-hot.
