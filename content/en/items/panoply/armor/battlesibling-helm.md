## Battlesibling Helm

This dented bronze helm features a cracked pair of twin porcelain siblings wielding a sword and spear respectively. The crack runs right between them, shattering their once-held hands.

While worn, this helm enables any held sword or spear to transform into the other with a flick of the wrist.
