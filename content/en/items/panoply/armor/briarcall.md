## Briarcall

This thickly padded shirt features an stylized blackberry bramble; the berries at the hems are sewen with tarnished silver thread.

I confirmed the seller's claim via experimentation; the wearer of this armor can drive their fingers into the dirt to cause a thin hedge of blackberry to sprout for two yards in either direction; thick enough to prevent sight through it.
