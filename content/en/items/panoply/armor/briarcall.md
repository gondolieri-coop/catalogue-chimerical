## Briarcall

This thickly padded shirt features an stylized blackberry bramble; the berries at the hems are
sewen with tarnished silver thread.

I confirmed the seller's claim via experimentation; the wearer of this armor can drive their
fingers into the dirt to cause a thin hedge of blackberry to sprout for two yards in either
direction; thick enough to prevent sight through it.

I laugh even now remembering how serious you were about borrowing this armor. Though I admit,
the picnic in the blackberry maze you prepared for us was a true joy.
