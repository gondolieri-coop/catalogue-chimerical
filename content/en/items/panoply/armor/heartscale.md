## Heartscale

This thick drakeleather breastplate is covered with a layer of ironoak scales shaped like distressingly anatomically accurate hearts. When worn, firelight seems to pulse with the wearer's heartbeat.

This work was purchased with a certification of veracity from the Spearspire. Any time the wearer's blood splashes one of the heartscales, their heartbeat becomes audible for everyone nearby; whoever spilled their blood hears it distractingly loud, like the tolling of a bell.
