## Fireheart Skirt

This skirt of thick sienna drakeleather is ribbed with whalebone carved like licking flames
spreading downward from the belt that cinches it; in the buckle sits a small piece of faded red
coral, it's texture nearly polished away.

The effect of this work was confirmed by way of Truthing dweomer on a witness to its owner's
death in a street fight. By touching the belt buckle with a bloodied finger, the wearer of this
skirt causes the center of gravity nearby to shift to the gem in the buckle for one minute,
though each use smooths away more of the coral.
