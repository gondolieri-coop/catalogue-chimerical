## Iron Spiron's Vambraces

This lavish pair of enamelled vambraces is chased with varying veins of polished and rusted iron surrounded by opaline scrollwork, swirling and abstract, a display of inordinate wealth.

The wearer can block or deflect any incoming blow, reducing it to nothingness; doing so rusts one of the iron veins to nothing. If used against iron, the deflected item is destroyed and a vein is restored.
