## Iron Spiron's Vambraces

This lavish pair of enamelled vambraces is chased with varying veins of polished and rusted iron
surrounded by opaline scrollwork, swirling and abstract, a display of inordinate wealth.

I verified both functions of this work at great, though worthy, expense; I did not, however,
thoroughly replicate the experiment due to the associated costs. The wearer can block or deflect
any incoming blow, reducing it to nothingness; doing so rusts one of the iron veins to nothing.
If used against iron, the deflected item is destroyed and a vein is restored.
