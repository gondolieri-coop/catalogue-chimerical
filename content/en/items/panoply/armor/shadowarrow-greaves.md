## Shadowarrow Greaves

This pair of ochre linen greaves is reinforced with thin bands of ironoak shaped like arrows in flight; Their leather straps feature ironoak buckles carved with runes of shadow which dance slowly when fastened.

Anyone wearing these greaves finds that so long as they move in the shade their speed is doubled; clicking these greaves together sharpens all shadows the wearer stands in for the next ten minutes, doubling this effect.
