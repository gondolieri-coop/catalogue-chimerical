## Shadowarrow Greaves

This pair of ochre linen greaves is reinforced with thin bands of ironoak shaped like arrows in
flight; Their leather straps feature ironoak buckles carved with runes of shadow which dance
slowly when fastened.

I verified this donated work via experimentation. Anyone wearing these greaves finds that so
long as they move in the shade their speed is doubled; clicking these greaves together sharpens
all shadows the wearer stands in for the next ten minutes, doubling this effect.
