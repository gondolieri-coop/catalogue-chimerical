## Breastplate of Cracking Dawn

This linen breastplate is enamelled like a sunburst, at the heart of which is a much-cracked
thumb-sized porcelain disc repaired with gold.

My verification confirmed that any time the enamel disk is cracked it emits a blast of light as
brilliant and warm as the first rays of dawn, though it must be repaired with gold to do so
again.
