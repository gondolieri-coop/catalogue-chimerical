## Myopic Drakemask Helm

This extravagant bronze helm is polished mirror bright and includes an ironoak face mask carved like a raging drake with a hole for the mouth but not eyes. From the carved eyes run rivulets of blood, seemingly fresh.

When the facemask is in place, the bearer can see nothing but their enemy, whom they see moving in slow motion compared to their own reflexes. For every minute the helm is worn, the bearer's tears will be bloody for one day.
