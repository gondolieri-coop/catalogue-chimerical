## Saffron Cap

This scale cap is made of drakebones painted with small purple flowers and featuring small bronze protrusions like saffron stamens, polished so smooth they're nearly soft to the touch.

Donated with instructions as to its use, I confirmed that any of the stamens of this cap may be plucked by the wearer to reveal a needle point; if inserted into the earth, a patch of saffron will grow rapidly over the next day.
