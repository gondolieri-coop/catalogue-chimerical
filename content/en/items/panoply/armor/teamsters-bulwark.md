## Teamsters' Bulwark

This hauberk is made of drakebone layered over pale blue leather and features marble discs
showing folk standing before wagons, fists raised as wealthy folk approach, swords drawn.

I verified this work's effect by tracking down the aged donar and having them recount it under a
Truthing dweomer. The disks of this hauberk may be detached and given by the wearer to anyone;
while fighting shoulder to shoulder, they are twice as hard to kill or push back. Separated,
twice as easy.
