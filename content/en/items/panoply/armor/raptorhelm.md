## Raptorhelm

A hemisphere of dull bronze chased with tarnished silver depicting ravens attacking and a golden eagle cawing.

The last bearer was always attacked on sight by corvids when the moon was up until, finally, one removed her eye and she elected to give up the helmet. She swears she dreamt of the golden eagle but could never understand its caws.
