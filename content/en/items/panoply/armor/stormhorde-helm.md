## Stormhorde Helm

This closed-face bronze helm is embossed with renderings of all sorts of symbols of earthly and spiritual wealth; coins, prayers, wind, crops, cards, laughter, love, glory, ships, and fruit; hammered into the face, however, are tiny iron lightning bolts, all leading to the eye holes.

The wearer of this helm feels and hears a soft crackling at all times, an endless nagging; by focusing on it, they cause a bolt of lightning to shoot from their eyes, robbing them of their vision temporarily but ending the crackling for a time.
