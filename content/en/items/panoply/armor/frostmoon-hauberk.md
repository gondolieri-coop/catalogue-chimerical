## Frostmoon Hauberk

This is knee-length full-sleeved linen shirt is thickly padded, featuring a pleasantly abstract
rendering of the moon sewn above ironoak spires secured over the belly.

I was able to verify the donar's claim that this hauberk is exceptionally uncomfortably warm to
wear except in moonlight, when the very air around the wearer begins to freeze and still,
frosting everything nearby in moments.

I know my years in your city have changed me. Simply rereading these words, I found myself
mouthing the name of the sun as I remembered that coldly depicted moon.
