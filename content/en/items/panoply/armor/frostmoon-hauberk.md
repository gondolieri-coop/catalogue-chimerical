## Frostmoon Hauberk

This is knee-length full-sleeved linen shirt is thickly padded, featuring a pleasantly abstract rendering of the moon sewn above ironoak spires secured over the belly.

The hauberk is exceptionally uncomfortably warm to wear except in moonlight, when the very air around the wearer begins to freeze and still, frosting everything nearby in moments.
