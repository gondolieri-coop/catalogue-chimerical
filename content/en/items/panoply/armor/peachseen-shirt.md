## Peachseen Shirt

This boiled and waxed linen shirt features a silver-threadedd peach tree espaliered; on
inspection, the leaves are sewn with tiny eyes. Several of the branches seem to have already had
their fruit plucked.

The seller of this work was able to demonstrate its effect to my satisfaction, though not
reconfirmed personally (due to the nature of its use). The wearer of this armor can, in direct
sunlight, pull a peach from it, the fruit materializing in their hand and disappearing from the
artwork. For ten minutes after eating the peach the wearer is nigh invisible in shade but leaves
behind a strong scent of crushed peaches.
