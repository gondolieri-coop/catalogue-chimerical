## Peachseen Shirt

This boiled and waxed linen shirt features a silver-threadedd peach tree espaliered; on inspection, the leaves are sewn with tiny eyes. Several of the branches seem to have already had their fruit plucked.

The wearer of this armor can, in direct sunlight, pull a peach from it, the fruit materializing in their hand and disappearing from the artwork. For ten minutes after eating the peach the wearer is nigh invisible in shade but leaves behind a strong scent of crushed peaches.
