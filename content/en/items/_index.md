This list of magical items includes the [items from _A Catalogue Chimerical_](/collected/) separated by category and subcategory.

## Compiler's Note
>
> The items in this catalogue are a selection of the curiosities I have obtained in the service of my fact finding mission for our most holy and sacred duty to the Great Treatises. Each of them, now that I have studied them, annotated them, and written an initial analysis of them, is available for purchase. If you forward the item and votive ink required for its purchase with a courier, the item will be sent to your specified address as usual for further study and analysis. I apologize in advance for the peculiarity and heresy described herein; the Pentolans are, on the whole, a less than enlightened people and much of what they produce is worthy of study if only for how bizarrely content they are with violating the sacred principles.
>
> Many of the items herein have perplexingly realistic depictions on them; while sometimes their work is pleasing to the eye, most often it frustratingly attempts to capture what Pentolans describe as the "truth of the world" instead of a holy abstract or geometric representation of it. Luckily, you do not (largely) need to find yourself exposed to much _soft art_ in this particular Catalogue. I do not mind telling you that such has been unfortunately inescapable in this city.
>
> If you find the names of these items quaint or even heretical, I apologize; I have merely recorded them with the name by which they were sold or donated.
>
> A final note: while I would love to be able to authenticate Runes of Integrity, this is not possible for most of these "works" as their artisan is either uninterested or unknown. A shame, perhaps, but these curios are, after all, largely heresy.
>
> I look forward to your correspondence.

> In accordance with the Great Treatises,

## Editor’s Note
>
> This catalogue is written from the perspective of NAME, a member of the nominal suzerains of Pentola, a complex theobureaucracy which maintains a palatial embassy in the city which is also a center of learning, medicine, aid, and watchful agents. NAME is an investigative scribe tasked with analyzing and cataloguing the artisanry of Pentola to further their people’s understanding of The Great Treatises, their countless set of holy tomes.
>
> The prices listed in this catalogue are given in vestive ink, their holy and standard currency, measured as:
>
> - a start, which is an amount of ink when a pen is lightly touched to a page,
> - a glyph, which is an amount of ink used to write a single character of the Writers’ language,
> - a prayer, which is an amount of ink used to write out the first sentence of the first Great Treatise,
> - or a vial, which is an amount of ink filling a whole bottle.
>
> For conversion purposes, one hundred starts are the cost of a good dagger; there are 30 starts to a glyph, 300 glyphs (or 9,000 starts)  to a prayer, and 150 prayers (or 45,000 glyphs, or 1,350,000 starts) to a vial.
