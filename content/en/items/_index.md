This list of magical items includes the [items from _A Catalogue Chimerical_](/collected/) separated by category and subcategory.

> ## Compiler's Note
>
> The items in this catalogue are a selection of the curiosities I have obtained in the service of my fact finding mission for our most holy and sacred duty to the Great Treatises.
> Each of them, now that I have studied them, annotated them, and written an initial analysis of them, is available for purchase.
> If you forward the item and votive ink required for its purchase with a courier, the item will be sent to your specified address as usual for further study and analysis.
> I apologize in advance for the peculiarity and heresy described herein; the Pentolans are, on the whole, a less than enlightened people and much of what they produce is worthy of study if only for how bizarrely content they are with violating the sacred principles.
>
> Many of the items herein have perplexingly realistic depictions on them; while sometimes their work is pleasing to the eye,
> most often it frustratingly attempts to capture what Pentolans describe as the "truth of the world" instead of a holy abstract or geometric representation of it.
> Luckily, you do not (largely) need to find yourself exposed to much _soft art_ in this particular Catalogue.
> I do not mind telling you that such has been unfortunately inescapable in this city.
>
> If you find the names of these items quaint or even heretical, I apologize; I have merely recorded them with the name by which they were sold or donated.
>
> A final note: while I would love to be able to authenticate Runes of Integrity, this is not possible for most of these "works" as their artisan is either uninterested or unknown.
> A shame, perhaps, but these curios are, after all, largely heresy.
>
> I look forward to your correspondence.

> In accordance with the Great Treatises,
