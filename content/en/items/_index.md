This list of magical items includes the [items from _A Catalogue Chimerical_](/collected/) separated
by category and subcategory.

## Compiler's Note

> The items in this catalogue are a selection of the curiosities I have obtained in the service of
> my fact finding mission for our most holy and sacred duty to the Great Treatises. Each of them,
> now that I have studied them, annotated them, and written an initial analysis of them, is
> available for purchase. If you forward the item and votive ink required for its purchase with a
> courier, the item will be sent to your specified address as usual for further study and analysis.
> I apologize in advance for the peculiarity and heresy described herein; the Pentolans are, on the
> whole, a less than enlightened people and much of what they produce is worthy of study if only for
> how bizarrely content they are with violating the sacred principles.
>
> Many of the items herein have perplexingly realistic depictions on them; while sometimes their
> work is pleasing to the eye, most often it frustratingly attempts to capture what Pentolans
> describe as the "truth of the world" instead of a holy abstract or geometric representation of it.
> Luckily, you do not (largely) need to find yourself exposed to much _soft art_ in this particular
> Catalogue. I do not mind telling you that such has been unfortunately inescapable in this city.
>
> If you find the names of these items quaint or even heretical, I apologize; I have merely recorded
> them with the name by which they were sold or donated.
>
> A final note: while I would love to be able to authenticate Runes of Integrity, this is not
> possible for most of these "works" as their artisan is either uninterested or unknown. A shame,
> perhaps, but these curios are, after all, largely heresy.
>
> I look forward to your correspondence.

My light,

If you are reading this, then I am gone--back to my people or on to the Gathering Hall to await
resurrection and the resumption of my work. In either case, know that I am missing you. I kept a
copy of this catalogue--half a decade of my work in your city--to annotate and reflect on. Though I
could not write my true thoughts for the publication, I am certain you will recognize your influence
in every last page.

You brought light to the shadows on my heart and revealed so much to my dulled eyes. Thank you. I
love you. I hope ardently to hold and be held by you again.

Ever yours,

Temzen

## Archivist's Note

This catalogue is written from the perspective of Temzen Horizon, an investigative scribe of the
Aydinlar. The Aydinlar have maintained their status as the nominal suzerains of Pentola; they're a
complex theobureaucracy which still maintains a palatial embassy in the city as a center of
learning, medicine, aid, and watchful agents. Temzen was an investigative scribe tasked with
analyzing and cataloguing the artisanry of Pentola to further their people’s understanding of The
Great Treatises, their countless set of holy tomes.

This copy of the catalogue was left to Temzen's Pentolan lover, Luca Boccasavia. It has been
annotated by Temzen as marginalia and serves as their honest reflection on the items in the
catalogue. In Luca's will, it was given to our archive with the express instructions that it may not
be released for one hundred and one years after their death. We have preserved it as exactingly as
possible, merely translating it to the modern tongue. We hope you find this curio valuable and
interesting in your own research.

The prices listed in this catalogue are given in vestive ink, the holy and standard currency of the
Aydinlar, measured as:

- a start, which is an amount of ink when a pen is lightly touched to a page,
- a glyph, which is an amount of ink used to write a single character of the Writers’ language,
- a prayer, which is an amount of ink used to write out the first sentence of the first Great Treatise,
- or a vial, which is an amount of ink filling a whole bottle.

For contextualizing these prices for modern folk, one hundred starts is roughly the cost of a good
dagger; there are 30 starts to a glyph, 300 glyphs (or 9,000 starts) to a prayer, and 150 prayers
(or 45,000 glyphs, or 1,350,000 starts) to a vial.
