## Lover's Light Robe

This short pale red linen robe has silver wire sewn through its edges displaying handsome men embracing. At the sleeves, tiny iron charms in the shape of faces, eyes closed, lips puckered.

While worn by someone in love, all light is brighter, everything more visible. When worn by someone who loves no-one, all light fades, hiding the wearer in shadow.
