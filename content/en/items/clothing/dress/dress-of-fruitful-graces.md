## Dress of Fruitful Graces

This short daffodil-yellow linen dress features an espaliered persimmon tree, its fruits
embroidered with golden threads.

A personal gift from a Pentolan artisan seeking enlightenment, I verified the effects with the
artisan present: anyone who makes eye contact with the wearer covets their attention and good
will, drawn towards them; if the wearer plucks a persimmon from the dress and hands it over, the
receiver becomes immune to this effect so long as they carry the persimmon.
