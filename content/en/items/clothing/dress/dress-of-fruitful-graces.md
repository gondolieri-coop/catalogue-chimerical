## Dress of Fruitful Graces

This short daffodil-yellow linen dress features an espaliered persimmon tree, its fruits embroidered with golden threads.

Anyone who makes eye contact with the wearer of this dress covets their attention and good will, drawn towards them; if the wearer plucks a persimmon from the dress and hands it over, the receiver becomes immune to this effect so long as they carry the persimmon.
