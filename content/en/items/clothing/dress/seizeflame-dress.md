## Seizeflame Dress

This long dress is made of violet linen without pattern or embellishment except for the a small porcelain badge of igniting flame sewn over the heart.

Donated during a charity gala, this work's effect was verified prior to donation: when worn it ripples and undulates away from the porcelain badge like flames licking outward; the wearer can reach out and pull flame into the dress, surrounding themself with fire that burns everything else.
