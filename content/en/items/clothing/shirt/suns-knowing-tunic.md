## Sun's Knowing Tunic

This long silk shirt is dyed a brilliant pink and features a pair of lovers watching the break
of dawn, the sun's rays sewn on as polished bronze plates.

Gifted by a Pentolan ambassador, this work's effects were confirmed to my satisfaction: worn in
sunlight, this tunic enables the wearer and their partner to share thoughts instantaneously, but
prevents the wearer from speaking aloud.

Left absolutely unsaid here, of course, is the truth of my relationship with that ambassador or
why the gift was made to me.
