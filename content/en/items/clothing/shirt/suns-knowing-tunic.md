## Sun's Knowing Tunic

This long silk shirt is dyed a brilliant pink and features a pair of lovers watching the break of dawn, the sun's rays sewn on as polished bronze plates.

Worn in sunlight, this tunic enables the wearer and their partner to share thoughts instantaneously, but prevents the wearer from speaking aloud.
