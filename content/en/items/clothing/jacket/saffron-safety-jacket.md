## Saffron Safety Jacket

This frivolously thin linen jacket is sewn with iron studs in the shape of saffron stems, slightly rusty. It smells strongly of the depicted herb.

Donated by a penitent seeking enlightenment and confirmed via minimal experimentation with a willing local participant. While worn, the wearer finds themself extremely clear minded, regardless of their physical condition or alchemical impairment; this clarity does not extend to control over their body's functions.
