## Anchor's Apron

This sturdy linen apron has an anchor sewn into the front, the heart of which is a cluster of small cracked lapis lazuli. No matter how long it is left to dry, it's always a little damp when worn.

When worn, everyone working around the wearer feels their steps are light, effortless, regardless of how much they carry or long they work.
