## Anchor's Apron

This sturdy linen apron has an anchor sewn into the front, the heart of which is a cluster of
small cracked lapis lazuli. No matter how long it is left to dry, it's always a little damp when
worn.

This work was confiscated from a pair of thieves caught attempting to leave our grounds with
sundry common goods; when worn, everyone working around the wearer feels their steps are light,
effortless, regardless of how much they carry or long they work. The thieves have since become
students in our weekly courses and seek enlightenment earnestly, if clumsily.
