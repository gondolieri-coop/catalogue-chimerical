## Moonscream Cloak

This pale yellow cloak is marred by a screaming mask of silver thread, the agape mouth holding a small iron moon upon its tongue. Picking it up always induces a spasming chill.

If the wearer of this cloak screams while the moon is overhead they become the source of an eldritch blast that escapes their lips in a shattering wave; until the next moonrise, they can hear nothing but their own echoing scream.
