## Moonscream Cloak

This pale yellow cloak is marred by a screaming mask of silver thread, the agape mouth holding a
small iron moon upon its tongue. Picking it up always induces a spasming chill.

Purchased at auction, the notes for this work covered only its primary effect, which I verified:
when the wearer screams while the moon is overhead they become the source of an eldritch blast
that escapes their lips in a shattering wave; unfortunately, I also discovered that until the
next moonrise, they can hear nothing but their own echoing scream.
