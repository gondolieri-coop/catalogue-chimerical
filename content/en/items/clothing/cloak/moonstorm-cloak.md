## Moonstorm Cloak

This thick woolen cloak is shaded even in direct sunlight, featuring storm bolts and a small iron moon between the shoulders. In moonlight, the bolts glow fiercely.

Sold by an agent of Spire Basilisco in exchange for access to a copy of a treatise on liquor by a Gascon "scholar," verified via demonstration: the bearer can, while in direct moonlight, grab a bolt from the cloak and fling it, striking the target with lightning.
