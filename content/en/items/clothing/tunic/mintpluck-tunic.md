## Mintpluck Tunic

This rich green linen tunic is embroidered with a massive golden peppermint, the flowers made of threaded silver. It fills the air with the same smell, always fresh.

Donated anonymously and without any notes, the work's effect was discovered via meticulous experimentation over several months: when the wearer plucks a leaf from a cultivar, the leaf they pull free is thrice as large as it seemed when they grabbed hold.
