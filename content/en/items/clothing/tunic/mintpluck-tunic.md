## Mintpluck Tunic

This rich green linen tunic is embroidered with a massive golden peppermint, the flowers made of threaded silver. It fills the air with the same smell, always fresh.

If the wearer of this tunic plucks a leaf from a cultivar, the leaf they pull free is thrice as large as it seemed when they grabbed hold.
