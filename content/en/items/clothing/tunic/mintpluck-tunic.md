## Mintpluck Tunic

This rich green linen tunic is embroidered with a massive golden peppermint, the flowers made of
threaded silver. It fills the air with the same smell, always fresh.

Donated anonymously and without any notes, the work's effect was discovered via meticulous
experimentation over several months: when the wearer plucks a leaf from a cultivar, the leaf
they pull free is thrice as large as it seemed when they grabbed hold.

Your insistence on using this at the Gardener's Festival very nearly got you thrown out and me
exposed! Although those delicious fist-sized strawberries were worth it, in the end.
