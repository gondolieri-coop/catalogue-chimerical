## Burning Bonedance Tunic

This thick black drakeleather tunic has been set with silver skeletons leaping and dancing through golden flames across the tunic's front. While worn, nearby flames dance with excitement.

Purchased at auction after seeing it used in a gladiatorial exhibition, the trigger confirmed by the previous owner via Truthing dweomer. Anyone whose blood is splashed or smeared on one of the tunic's skeletons while it worn is overwhelmed by excruciating pain as their marrow heats rapidly; if they do not flee beyond the wearer's sight, they will be fully engulfed in flame after a minute.
