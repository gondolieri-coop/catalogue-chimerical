## Red Rage Tunic

This pale pink linen tunic features a crimson-glazed figure of a furious Pentolan drakerider in
full panoply, spear raised. The hem is lined with thin opaline panels, each carved with a word
like "sacrifice", "glory", and "perseverance".

Purchased at auction after the Dawndrake Race, verified by the previous owner via the Truthing
dweomer. While worn, the wearer can channel the rage of the depicted drakerider, all aggression
coming easy and fast, though they become single-mindedly focused on conflict and victory until
they drop from exhaustion or the tunic is removed by someone else.
