## Red Rage Tunic

This pale pink linen tunic features a crimson-glazed figure of a furious Pentolan drakerider in full panoply, spear raised. The hem is lined with thin opaline panels, each carved with a word like "sacrifice", "glory", and "Perseverance".

While worn, the wearer can channel the rage of the drakerider, all aggression coming easy and fast, though they become single-mindedly focused on conflict and victory until they drop from exhaustion or the tunic is removed by someone else.
