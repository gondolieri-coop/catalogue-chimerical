## Spearmother's Tunic

This deep green tunic depicts an elderly woman turning ash poles into spears, embroidered onto the chest in bronze wire.

While worn, any stave held by the wearer grows an eldritch leaf-bladed head, blunt until the wearer's blood touches it; until they let go of the stave, the blade can cut through anything, even dweomers.
