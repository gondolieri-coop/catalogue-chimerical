## Spearmother's Tunic

This deep green tunic depicts an elderly woman turning ash poles into spears, embroidered onto the chest in bronze wire.

A gift from the Spearspiron to show goodwill and demonstrated on gifting: while worn, any stave held by the wearer grows an eldritch leaf-bladed head, blunt until the wearer's blood touches it; until they let go of the stave, the blade can cut through anything, even dweomers.
