## Held Hands Wrap

This silken lavendar wrap features dozens of small hands entwined around a wand of holly, each
made of ironoak. Between the fingers, a pale green mold slowly grows.

Purchased from a widower and confirmed via the Truthing dweomer: while worn, any matrix the
wearer holds can be used by a loved one, so long as they entwine their fingers with the wearer.
Any dweomer cast through the matrix is twice as powerful if cast this way. An astonishingly
narrowly authored work unfortunately rife with base Pentolan sentimentality.

I suppose my digs at sentimentality here provided me with enough cover. I remember the way your
lips curled when we tried this for ourselves, applying children's dweomers in your garden.
