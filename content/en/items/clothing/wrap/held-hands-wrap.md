## Held Hands Wrap

This silken lavendar wrap features dozens of small hands entwined around a wand of holly, each made of ironoak. Between the fingers, a pale green mold slowly grows.

While worn, any matrix the wearer holds can be used by a loved one, so long as they entwine their fingers with the wearer. Any dweomer cast through the matrix is twice as powerful if cast this way.
