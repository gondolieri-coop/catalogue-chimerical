## Fealty Feast Bib

This thick linen bib is luxuriously lined with polished iron strips, an unbelievable expenditure
of wealth on a near-useless item.

This work was donated with simple notes which required rather intensive experimentation to
verify: anyone who eats beside the bib-wearer tastes only copper, all things rendered to taste
like blood unless they deign to kiss the bib, further polishing the iron. Anyone who does so
instead finds every morsel delectable, perfect to their taste regardless of actual composition.
Another mostly pointless Pentolan work obviated by gardening according to The Great Treatises.

While I do still love food from home, I struggle to imagine how I could possibly forget the food
you've made for me. There's more to dining than the Great Treatises claim.
