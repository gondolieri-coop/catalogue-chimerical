## Artisan's Aid Gloves

This pair of golden drakeleather gloves is studded with ironoak shaped like Pentolan card money, each face card carefully inlaid with tiny iron charms.

While worn, the wearer's hands are as youthful and spry as when they were teenagers, all aches and stiffness held off until the gloves are removed.
