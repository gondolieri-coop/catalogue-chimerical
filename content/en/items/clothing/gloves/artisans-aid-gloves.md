## Artisan's Aid Gloves

This pair of golden drakeleather gloves is studded with ironoak shaped like Pentolan card money,
each face card carefully inlaid with tiny iron charms.

This work was donated to an elderly gardener in our complex by a local artisan; the gardener
turned them over to me in accordance with The Great Treatises for analysis. While worn, the
wearer's hands are as youthful and spry as when they were teenagers, all aches and stiffness
held off until the gloves are removed. After the effects were confirmed, the gardener declined
to retake possession of the gloves, preferring to work in sacred harmony as is correct.
