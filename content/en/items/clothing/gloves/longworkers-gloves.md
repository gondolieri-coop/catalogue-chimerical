## Longworker's Gloves

These sky-blue drakeleather gloves feature small opals set into the first knuckle of each digit. A purple-gray mold grows in the shape of the Watchful Moon from the palm of each glove, regrowing in moonlight if scraped away.

The wearer's hands never tire nor grow sore from work. The mold can be infused and drunk as a tea; the wearer finds the tea deeply bitter but others find it sweet and rejuvinating, filling them with energy as if they'd just woken from a relaxing nap.
