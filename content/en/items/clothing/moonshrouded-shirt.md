## Moonshrouded Shirt

This deep purple linen shirt is sewn with extraordinarily thin iron wire in the shape of a cloud-shrouded moon over the right breast. Between the wires grows a pale green mold, clinging to the shirt in flaky outgrowths.

The wearer can always see the moon's outline, no matter what it is hidden behind. In moonlight, the mold grows noticeably. If scraped from the shirt, the mold can be ingested to give the consumer uncanny sight in moonless darkness.
