## Mintstorm Tunic

This tunic is idiomatic of Pentolan fashion, woven from some alchemically cultivated form of mint, and it smells like it. Darker leaves are woven around the hem in the shape of storm clouds.

After discussion with the auctioneer, we tested and verified that the tunic makes the bearer extremely prone to lightning strikes, but immune to their destructive power.
