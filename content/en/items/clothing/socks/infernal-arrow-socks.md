## Infernal Arrow Socks

This pair of silken sunset-orange knee-high socks features opaline arrows swirling like flames across the top of the foot.

Purchased at gladiator's auction in which the work's effects were demonstrated, though not replicated for safety reasons. While worn openly, these socks protect the wearer from projectiles, burning them to ash in brilliant explosions as they approach; if the opaline arrows are covered, the projectiles instead superheat and strike unerringly.
