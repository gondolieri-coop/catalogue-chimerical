## Timeburning Socks

This pair of long ash-washed lace socks has beads of golden flame fringing it, surprisingly
damp.

Donated in gratitude for medical services rendered, the donar confirmed the work's effect via
Truthing dweomer: while worn, these socks burn away the advances of time, slowing it to a crawl.
For every year they are worn, another golden bead disintegrates.
