## Skirt of the Dancing Step

This celadon linen skirt features beads of porcelain sewn into the image of a vibrant and joyous woman dancing in the street. At the waist, a band of silk with opalescent scrollwork in whorls and waves.

The wearer finds that their every step is sure and they alway feel like dancing. Anyone who sees the wearer danced is entranced; the less they already like the wearer, the more they find they cannot tear their sight away.
