## Moonkiss Handkerchief

This richly black handkerchief features a field of ironoak stars sewn around a silver-threaded rune shaped like the moon.

Acquired from the auction of a would be drakerider who failed her exam, this work's reported effects were verified with simple experimentation: while worn, if the moon is facing outward under moonlight, the wearer heals from any new injuries with astonishing speed; if the wearer steps out of the moonlight before the moon fully sets, the wounds reopen just as quickly.
