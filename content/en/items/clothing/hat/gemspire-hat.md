## Gemspire Hat

This tall conical hat is made of stiffened mint-green drakeleather, pleasantly tooled with
geometric patterns of rings and lines. Set into each ring is a small precious stone--mostly
diamonds, sapphires, and emeralds.

The artisan of this work sold it to us when their patron defaulted on payment and was willing to
describe and demonstrate it in detail. While worn, the wearer cannot help but be noticed by
anyone and everyone; merely looking at the hat in passing captures the attention to a degree
that requires an onlooker to consciously wrestle their gaze away. The interview with the artisan
is, of course, included in my larger corpus of analysis, but I am happy to include a copy of it
with purchase.

You never needed to wear it to capture the attention of anyone. I certainly remain captivated.
