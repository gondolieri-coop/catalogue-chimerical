## Gemspire Hat

This tall conical hat is made of stiffened mint-green drakeleather, pleasantly tooled with geometric patterns of rings and lines. Set into each ring is a small precious stone--mostly diamonds, sapphires, and emeralds.

While worn, the wearer cannot help but be noticed by anyone and everyone; merely looking at the hat in passing captures the attention to a degree that requires an onlooker to consciously wrestle their gaze away.
