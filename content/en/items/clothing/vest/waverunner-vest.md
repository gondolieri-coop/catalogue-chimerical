## Waverunner Vest

This thin vest is made of supple aquamarine drakeleather, tooled with small golden ships
skittering across waves tooled into it.

Donated by a mariner seeking enlightenment and confirmed via experimentation: the wearer finds
that they can run quickly enough to race across water for short distances, so long as their feet
are wet with that water first.
