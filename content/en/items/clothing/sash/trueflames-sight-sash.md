## Trueflame's Sight Sash

This gold-and-violet sash is pleasingly patterned like an abstraction of roiling flame, though it is marred by a dozen tiny iron eyes sewn chaotically into it.

The wearer of this sash can pluck one of the iron eyes from this sash and press it into their own eye socket, filling it with flame that burns away all falsehood and deceit from their view.
