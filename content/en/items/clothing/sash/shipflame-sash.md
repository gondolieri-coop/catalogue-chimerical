## Shipflame Sash

This azure sash features a nine burning ships embroidered with thin iron wire, some of it rusting slowly. Three more rusty effigies of ships dot the sash.

If the wearer of this sash touches a ship and then a flammable object, the object bursts into intense flame and rust crawls over the ship's wire. Each ship seem to be capable of being used three times before it rusts to nothing.
