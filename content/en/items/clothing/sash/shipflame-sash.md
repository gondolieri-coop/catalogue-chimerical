## Shipflame Sash

This azure sash features a nine burning ships embroidered with thin iron wire, two of them partially rusted. Three more rusty effigies of ships dot the sash.

Donated by a captain seeking enlightenment and a life off the waves and verified by way of Truthing dweomer: if the wearer touches a ship and then a flammable object, the object bursts into intense flame and rust crawls over the ship's wire. Each ship may be used three times before it rusts to nothing.
