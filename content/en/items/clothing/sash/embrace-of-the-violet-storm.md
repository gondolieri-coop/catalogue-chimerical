## Embrace of the Violet Storm

This pink silk waist wrap features purple threads in the image of the Violet Storm, strewn with tiny amethysts. Picking it up causes a powerful static shock.

The wearer of this wrap does not appear to age but feels an overpowering desire to go out and brave the Violet Storm when it comes. If they do survive, the effects of the wrap endure even when not worn. If the wrap is ever removed, they age as if ten times as much time had passed since they first wore it.
