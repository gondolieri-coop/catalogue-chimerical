## Ashdawn Vineyard Sash

This bleached linen sash is embroidered with a prodigious vineyard growing from ash-thick earth, the grapes made of tiny amethysts. The ends of the the sash feature small bronze plates with violet silk tassles.

If this sash is wrapped around flora planted in ash and left where it will get sunlight, the plant will grow as if a week has passed for each sunrise. Every dawn another amethyst grape vanishes.
