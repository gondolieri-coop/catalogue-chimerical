## Ashdawn Vineyard Sash

This bleached linen sash is embroidered with a prodigious vineyard growing from ash-thick earth,
the grapes made of tiny amethysts. The ends of the the sash feature small bronze plates with
violet silk tassles.

Sold by the aunt of the artisan who made it after he failed to return from the Catacombs, I was
able to verify the claimed effect via experimentation: if this sash is wrapped around flora
planted in ash and left where it will get sunlight, the plant will grow as if a week has passed
for each sunrise. Every dawn another amethyst grape vanishes. Dozens of grapes remain.
