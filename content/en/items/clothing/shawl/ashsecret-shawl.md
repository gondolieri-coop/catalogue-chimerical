## Ashsecret Shawl

This ash-gray shawl's fringes wave and flicker like living fire, warm to the touch.

Donated by a convert in the Farewell Ward, I was able to verify the claims donar (who is also
the artisanal author). Anything hidden inside the shawl while worn shrinks to be nearly
weightless and undetectable, regardless of how bulky it is *so long as* it can be properly
covered by the shawl. My interview notes from the investigation are available on request at no
extra cost.
