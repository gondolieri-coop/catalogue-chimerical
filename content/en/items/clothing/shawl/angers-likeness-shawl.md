## Anger's Likeness Shawl

This scorched linen shawl is embroidered with colorful silk faces, placid and near-featureless.

Purchased from a Gondolieri who was willing to verify the claimed effect via Truthing dweomer: while worn, the anger of everyone nearby is reflected in the faces of the shawl, taking their likeness and changing their expression to display their frustration or fury.
