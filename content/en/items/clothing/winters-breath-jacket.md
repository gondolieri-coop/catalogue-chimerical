## Winter's Breath Jacket

This thick dawn-gray linen jacket is stuffed with goose down and features golden thread woven into the hems and into an esoteric rune on the back which looks like a distorted snowflake made of arrowheads.

The wearer never feels the cold though their breath always clouds in a thick fog. Snow which lands on the jacket is immediately subsumed by it, disappearing in a flash of steam.
