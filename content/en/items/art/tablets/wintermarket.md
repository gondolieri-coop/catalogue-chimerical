## Wintermarket

This silver tablet is small enough to hold in one hand and inlaid with aquamarine and topaz, depicting a bustling snow-blanketed market with dozens of people trading and conversing. The entire thing is lined with iridescent opaline scrollwork of tiling snowflakes.

When the bearer of this tablet's breath frosts in the air, they find that haggling comes easy to them, as does accurate appraisal for any goods being sold. Anyone attempting to mislead the bearer finds their lips blue visibly while doing so.
