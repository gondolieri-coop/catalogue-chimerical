## Wintermarket

This silver tablet is small enough to hold in one hand and inlaid with aquamarine and topaz,
depicting a bustling snow-blanketed market with dozens of people trading and conversing. The
entire thing is lined with iridescent opaline scrollwork of tiling snowflakes.

The artisan's claim for this work took frustratingly long to prove: when the bearer of this
tablet's breath frosts in the air, they find that haggling comes easy to them, as does accurate
appraisal for any goods being sold. Anyone attempting to mislead the bearer finds their lips
blue visibly while doing so. Not very useful, given that such a climate is only seen for a few
days a year in our homeland.
