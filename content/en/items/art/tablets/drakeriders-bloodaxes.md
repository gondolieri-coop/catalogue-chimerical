## Drakerider's Bloodaxes

This card-sized oak tablet features a pair of crossed porcelain battle axes in the style often carried by Pentolan drakeriders, their blades stained with dried blood.

Purchased from an unfortunate gladiator's auction after seeing it in use and verified again after. Smearing one's own blood onto the blade of either axe allows the bearer to pull it free from the tablet, upon which they grow to full size and cleave through anything but iron with ease. They shrink again when the blood covering them dries.
