## Slowplay Tablet

This Pentolan marble tablet features parents embracing while they watch small children race around a garden; the faces of the children are marred, replaced with a rune.

Any room this tablet has been displayed in for a moonrise makes everyone in it move frustratingly slow, at no more than half their normal speed for even the simplest actions.
