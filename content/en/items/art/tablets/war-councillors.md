## War Councillors

This willow-woven tablet secures a bas relief of warriors in the Pentolan panoply huddled around a dirt map, conversing and holding their weapons. In flickering light, it hums softly, like a distant conversation barely heard.

Sold by a retired mercenary captain, I confirmed that plans made in the presence of this tablet come together with ease, participants able to cut through language barriers and see second and third order effects of any proposition.
