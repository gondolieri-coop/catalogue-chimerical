## Moonroot Tablet

This azure-lacquered tablet has a moon-bent tree made from polished ironoak laid into its face, the roots of which entangle each other and protrude from the tablet to end in small spikes.

When a group of people prick their finger upon the roots of the tree together, the root painfully breaks from the tablet, lodging itself as a splinter. Those who bear the splinters alway know the precise direction and distance to one another but also find themselves overcome with lust for each other when in moonlight.
