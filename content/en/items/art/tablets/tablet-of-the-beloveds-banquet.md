## Tablet of the Beloved's Banquet

This small stone tablet depicts a pair of men holding hands as they share a single bowl of noodles, their eyes bright and laughing. Gazing on it for more than a few seconds fills your nostrils with the rich smell of charred ginger and roasted onion.

While holding the tablet and looking at it, you can whisper a short message to the last person you shared a meal with and they will hear you, wherever they are. Using the tablet makes you ravenously hungry.
