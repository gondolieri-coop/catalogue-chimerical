## Hoardeater Tablet

This clay tablet is shaped like a cackling merchant in eerily lifelike detail, gazing at a hoard of gold and silver playing cards falling through their fingers. In their yawning mouth grows a mold like dried blood.

When this tablet is hung in a room, everyone who can see it feels a growing desire to count their material wealth. We verified the claim of the prior owner that scraping the mold and mixing it into a tea allows the drinker to eat precious objects, staving off illness and aging for a time correlating to the perceived value of the objects eaten.
