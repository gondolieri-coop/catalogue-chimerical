## Stonethought Kettle

This kettle is crafted of Pentolan marble and features surprisingly abstract opaline scrollwork
depicting insect-like creatures beneath a copse of massive angular trees carved into the kettle
itself.

I was able to discover via experimentation after consulting and thinking on the Great Treatises
that drinking any tea from this kettle causes a curious change in the perception of time; a
single sip turns seconds into minutes, though the drinker cannot move any faster during their
sip.
