## Magmatic Drake Cup

This simple earthenware cup is a perfectly shaped cylinder, as wide as it is tall, marred only by the Pentolan obsession with imagery, in this case depicting a bonedrake with molten stone (stylized with tiny rubies) dripping from its bony plates.

I had the donar validate their claim and then independently validated it myself with a mercenary drakerider; anyone who drinks from this cup feels intensely warm, sweating despite even the coolest night breeze. Any drake bonded with the drinker shares the effect amplified to the point their bony plates sear a fresh egg instantly. This does not seem to harm the drake in any noticeable way.
