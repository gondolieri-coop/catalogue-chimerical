## Magmatic Drake Cup

This simple earthenware cup is a perfectly shaped cylinder, as wide as it is tall, marred only by the Pentolan obsession with imagery, in this case depicting a bonedrake with molten stone (stylized with tiny rubies) dripping from its bony plates.

Anyone who drinks from this cup feels intensely warm, sweating despite even the coolest night breeze. Any drake bonded with the drinker shares the effect, only amplified tenfold, to the point their bony plates sear a fresh egg instantly.
