## Moonhoard Mug

This brilliant blue mug is beset with scores of tiny gems in a fractal depiction of riches raining from a pearl moon; the surface of the glazed and fired clay is polished to a mirror sheen.

When drinking from this cup, all observers find themselves impressed by the drinker's good taste and bearing, making them the most interesting and laudable person in the room. The drinker is similarly overcome with feelings of self satisfaction and a desire for more, more, more accolades.
