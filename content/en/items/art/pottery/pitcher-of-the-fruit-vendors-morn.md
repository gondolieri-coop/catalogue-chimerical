## Pitcher of the Fruit Vendor's Morn

This pitcher is rimmed with Pentolan marble and has dozens of tiny iron charms pressed into it, each shaped like a tiny fruit stand.

When a single slice of fruit is placed into it along with any drinkable liquid, the liquid is infused with the flavor of that fruit as if a full day had passed. Anyone who consumes a drink poured from this pitcher feels as if they've just awoken from a restful night's sleep.
