## Friendfeast Cup

This simple cup is glazed a pale orange, its thick rim made of smooth Pentolan marble featuring reclining friends chatting and drinking together. When left in the dark, it hums quietly, reminding listeners of their favorite tune.

Any non-alcoholic liquid drunk from this cup tastes like and has the effect of clean, cool water, regardless of origin. Any alcohol drunk from the cup is three times as potent in taste and effect.
