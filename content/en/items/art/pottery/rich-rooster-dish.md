## Rich Rooster Dish

This wide plate is slightly convex, featuring an inlaid silver rooster pecking at polished
copper card money. Picking it up always causes a distant crowing call to be heard.

I verified the claim attached to this work at auction with a common chicken and paid an
itinerant Thousand Princelings' merchant to test with one of their horses; when used to feed a
creature, that creature's plumage or fur slowly turns into precious metals which can be plucked
or sheared.
