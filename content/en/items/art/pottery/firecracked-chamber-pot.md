## Firecracked Chamber Pot

This old, cracked chamber pot is made of pale pink porcelain and repaired with bronze to fill
cracks like licking flames. Firelight in the presence of this pot dims and flickers, making the
area pleasantly dark.

This work was verified only by extensive use of the Truthing dweomer. For every year that this
chamber pot is used daily an additional crack filled with bronze slowly grows. Whoever used the
pot at least daily during that year finds themself inured against any illnesses or poisons
consumed. Only a Pentolan would author such an obscene work.

I think, after these years in the city and seeing so much suffering, that if I could find the
artisan who made this wonder I should set them up to make a thousand more and give them away.
