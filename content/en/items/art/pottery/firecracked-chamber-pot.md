## Firecracked Chamber Pot

This old, cracked chamber pot is made of pale pink porcelain and repaired with bronze to fill cracks like licking flames. Firelight in the presence of this pot dims and flickers, making the area pleasantly dark.

For every year that this chamber pot is used daily an additional crack filled with bronze slowly grows. Whoever used the pot at least daily during that year finds themself inured against any illnesses or poisons consumed.
