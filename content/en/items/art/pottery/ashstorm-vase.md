## Ashstorm Vase

This tall, thin porcelain vase is decorated with an almost pleasantly abstract rendering of a
pyroclastic flow; its neck is wrapped with a silk ribbon from which dangles a ring of polished
ironoak.

As demonstrated by the enlightened donar, any cut stem placed in this vase grows as if properly
grafted and grown in the most fertile volcanic soil, never wilting.
