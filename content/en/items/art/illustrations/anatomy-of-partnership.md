## Anatomy of Partnership

This sketchbook is half-filled with disturbingly accurate anatomical studies of various people, the copper plates that cover it etched with a pleasingly abstract rendering of a human heart.

We verified the prior owners claim; anyone who details a loved one with their own hand in this book creates a link between the artist and the subject, such that ailments and injuries upon the subject are rendered upon the artist and the illustration alike instead of the subject. Erasing an illustration severs the link but reportedly kills the subject immediately.
