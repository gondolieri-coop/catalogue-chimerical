## Anatomy of Partnership

This sketchbook is half-filled with disturbingly accurate anatomical studies of various people,
the copper plates that cover it etched with a pleasingly abstract rendering of a human heart.

I verified the prior owners claim by personal demonstration of the seller; anyone who details a
loved one with their own hand in this book creates a link between the artist and the subject,
such that ailments and injuries upon the subject are rendered upon the artist and the
illustration alike instead of the subject. Erasing an illustration reportedly severs the link
but reportedly kills the subject immediately; the seller was unwilling to prove this point.
