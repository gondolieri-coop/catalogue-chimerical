## Feast of the Ancient Juniper

This bronze disc is engraved with an ancient juniper thick with berries, piles of the berries building small mounds all around the base. From the top of the disc dangles a rich blue silk ribbon, long enough to tie.

If you eat juniper berries beneath the disc, you find that your age reverses by one day per berry eaten.
