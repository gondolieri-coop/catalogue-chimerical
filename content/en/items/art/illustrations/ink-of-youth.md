## Ink of Youth

This children's sketchbook features named stick figures of various people in a dozen different hands. The cover is marked with a surprisingly ornate rune, almost beautiful, though reading it makes one's eyes droop.

Purchased at auction and verified, anyone who draws a stick figure in this book and signs it with their name will regain as many years of youth as they draw lines for their figure. Drawing a second figure, however, reverses the effects threefold. The experiment subject was recompensed accordingly.
