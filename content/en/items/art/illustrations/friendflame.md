## Friendflame

This inked illustration of three friends dancing around a fire is pinned to a wafer thin sheet of Pentolan marble polished to a mirror shine.

I validated this work via meticulous experimentation and documentation. When three or more people join hands and _dance_ around a flame in the presence of this illustration, they are imbued with the _dance of the flames_ commensurate to their magnitude until the fire dies. If purchased, this item will include my analysis of the foolish soft art this work engenders in participants. It is fascinating, if utterly obscene.
