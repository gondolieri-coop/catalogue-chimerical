## Marine's Struggle

This charcoal drawing of a fierce ship-boarding battle has more _feeling_ than detail, showing swirling smoke and mortal struggle. The few pieces of armor depicted are made of iron shavings, not coal, and flicker violently in firelight.

Staring too long at this illustration fills the viewer's ears with the din of a hard-fought battle. For the next week, they are particularly attuned to the sounds that accompany violence, picking them out easily even a hundred yards away.
