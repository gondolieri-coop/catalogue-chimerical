## The Winter Aristocrat's Dinner

This painting of a thin, beautiful, long-haired person eating a luxurious feast alone at a table in the snow is, at first glance, a wonder. Closer inspection shows shadowy figures shivering at the edges in the dark, left out. Whatever figures were once painted there are covered now by a soft, porous mold that peels away easily but seems endless.

If the keeper of this painting ever refuses to share food, they find one of their digits slowly becomes frostbitten, but the person to whom they refused succor begins to turn in that same time to snow, their flesh giving way to separating crystals.
