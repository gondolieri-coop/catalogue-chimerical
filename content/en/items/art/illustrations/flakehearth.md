## Flakehearth

This beautifully abstract rendering of a burning snowflake features a sliver of pale blue diamond set into the center of the thick parchment, forming the snowflake itself.

When the Cold Front came through the city I was finally able to properly confirm the claim attatched to this work at auction; when unfurled, everyone nearby finds even the coldest day easy to endure, though their eyes slowly take on the color of the diamond. In my experimentation, this effect fades after about an hour. Useful perhaps for anyone travelling to colder climes, especially those trekking far hubward.
