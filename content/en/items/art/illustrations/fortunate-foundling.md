## Fortunate Foundling

This charcoal drawing of a child wearing fabulous clothes and draped with jewels is sketched on a thin sheet of ironoak. Dangling from one corner, a handful of tiny iron charms, three missing.

When one of the attached charms is removed and fed to someone younger than the owner, the child miraculously comes into wealth and luck at every turn; however, equal misfortune befalls the owner.
