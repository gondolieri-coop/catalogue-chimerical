## Fortunate Foundling

This charcoal drawing of a child wearing fabulous (if stereotypically Pentolan) clothes and draped with jewels is sketched on a thin sheet of ironoak. Dangling from one corner, a handful of tiny iron charms dangling from copper chains, three missing.

I was able to verify this work only by use of a Truthing dweomer on the seller's witness. When one of the attached charms is removed and fed to someone younger than the owner, the child miraculously comes into wealth and luck at every turn; however, equal misfortune befalls the owner.
