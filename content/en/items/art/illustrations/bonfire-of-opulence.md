## Bonfire of Opulence

This painting of a wealthy person framed in porcelain flame depicts them looking on as a pile of visible wealth burns, as Pentolan Spirons do every seventeen years, a ritualized rejection of the wealth they continue to possess.

I verified the seller's claim; the owner of this painting can push any item they own into the painting, slowly rendering it into the painting. The owner can later pull a copy of any item they placed in the painting, but it crumbles into ash at the next moon zenith. It is important that the item be given or sold; theft reportedly does not confer ownership.
