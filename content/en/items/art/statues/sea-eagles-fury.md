## Sea Eagle's Fury

This marble statue features a sea eagle rising from the waves, its eyes inlaid with bronze
flames, its talons blood stained.

Purchased from a falconer, we verified that, when kept in an aviary for at least nine sunrises,
the birds who roost near this statue can burst into flame on the command of whoever's blood last
splashed on the eagle's talons.
