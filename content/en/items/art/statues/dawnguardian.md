## Dawnguardian

This stone toy soldier fits in the hand and features a spearwoman holding her own helmeted head under her arm, her spearblade bright with polished iron. In every crease, pale red mold seeps like fungal blood.

Astonishingly, I confirmed that the bearer of this tiny statue can scrape up a modicum of the mold, prick their finger on the spear, and mix the two together to ingest; after doing so, the statue grows to the same size as them and takes orders until the sun rises again. Obviously, this borders on heresy; though as the work itself was authored and only performs as directed, it is less heretical than the authorless works authorlessly working common in this city.
