## Dawnguardian

This stone toy soldier fits in the hand and features a spearwoman holding her own helmeted head
under her arm, her spearblade bright with polished iron. In every crease, pale red mold seeps
like fungal blood.

Astonishingly, I confirmed that the bearer of this tiny statue can scrape up a modicum of the
mold, prick their finger on the spear, and mix the two together to ingest; after doing so, the
statue grows to the same size as them and takes orders until the sun rises again. Obviously,
this borders on heresy; though as the work itself was authored and only performs as directed, it
is less heretical than the authorless works authorlessly working common in this city.

The obsessive fear of authorless works I inherited from the Great Treatises and my teachers
seems so silly now. How many wonders did you show me which I could never annotate here?
