## Moonkissed Pond

This diorama of a marble moon suspended over a pond of saphhire is pleasantly abstract, not bothering to mimic "proper" proportions; the surface of the moon is polished somehow to feel like velvet. Beneath the flat surface of the pond, a dozen tiny precious stones.

Any stone placed on the pond's surface sinks slowly in moonlight, shrinking to a tenth its size. Retrieval of the gems does not seem possible without breaking the moon, based on my research.
