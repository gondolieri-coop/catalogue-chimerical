## Moonflame Pillar

This bronze statue of a pillaring flame is set into an octagonal plinth of Pentolan marble,
lavendar shot through with pale green veins.

I confirmed the attestation of the seller; in the presence of this statue, even the dimmest
conditions are navigable as if brightly lit, though in moonlight only surfaces illuminated by
that celestial body are visible at all.
