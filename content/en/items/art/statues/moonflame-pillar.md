## Moonflame Pillar

This bronze statue of a pillaring flame is set into an octagonal plinth of Pentolan marble, lavendar shot through with pale green veins.

In the presence of this statue, even the dimmest conditions are navigable as if brightly lit, though in moonlight only surfaces illuminated by that celestial body are visible at all.
