## Burning Matron

This bust of a Pentolan matron with flames for hair is vividly lifelike, down to every wrinkle
in her serenely thoughtful face. Her eyes, looking upward, are made of porcelain, and what
appears to be dried blood has trickled from her ears.

The artisan was able to demonstrate that thinking while looking into a fire while touching this
bust causes the flames themselves to visualize your thoughts, a flickering panorama.

Even after all these years, I can see her face when I close my eyes. I wonder who purchased her.
