## Burning Matron

This bust of a Pentolan matron with flames for hair is surprisingly lifelike, down to every wrinkle in her serenely thoughtful face. Her eyes, looking upward, are made of porcelain, and what appears to be dried blood has trickled from her ears.

Thinking while looking into a fire while touching this bust causes the flames themselves to visualize your thoughts, a flickering panorama.
