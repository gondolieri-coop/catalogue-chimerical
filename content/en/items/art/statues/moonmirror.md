## Moonmirror

This hand-wide statue of the Watchful Moon floats eerily a foot above whatever surface it is placed upon, sitting perfectly still in space. It is made entirely of wrought iron.

Anything lit by light reflected from this statue becomes weightless while so lit. Anything lit by actual moonlight reflected from this statue withers quickly away, aging a year each second it is exposed.
