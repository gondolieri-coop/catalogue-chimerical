## Hearty Ship

This 1:600 scale model of a Pentolan warship is, perhaps, useful to study for future conflict; the entire thing is made of ironoak and assembled with precision, a full replica.

I am assured by both the impoverished captain who auctioned this item as well as our own verification that so long as this ship is floated in water any effects of aging or sickness will effect the model instead.
