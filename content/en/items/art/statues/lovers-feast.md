## Lover's Feast

This lifelike bronze statue depicts lovers feading each other chunks of bread dripping honey,
their limbs entwined. Their lips are stained red with dried blood.

I was able to verify the seller's claim that any food eaten in the presence of these statues
without a loved one robs the food of all taste; even the "simplest" fare is delectable if shared
with a friend or partner. Experiments showed that this sentimentality is, indeed, critical;
though of course, Pentolan cuisine is needlessly over-handled.

I apologize for the notes about Pentolan cuisine and sentimentality; I think this still barely
passed the censors. Your braised eel with sweet sauce remains my favorite dish.
