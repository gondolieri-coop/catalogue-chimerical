## Lover's Feast

This bronze statue depicts lovers feading each other chunks of bread dripping honey, their limbs entwined. Their lips are stained red with dried blood.

Any food eaten in the presence of these statues without a loved one robs the food of all taste; even the simplest fare is delectable if shared with a friend or partner.
