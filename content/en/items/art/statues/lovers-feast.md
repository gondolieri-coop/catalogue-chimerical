## Lover's Feast

This lifelike bronze statue depicts lovers feading each other chunks of bread dripping honey, their limbs entwined. Their lips are stained red with dried blood.

I was able to verify the seller's claim that any food eaten in the presence of these statues without a loved one robs the food of all taste; even the "simplest" fare is delectable if shared with a friend or partner. Experiments showed that this sentimentality is, indeed, critical; though of course, Pentolan cuisine is needlessly over-handled.
