## Moonbattle Brush

This stiff brush has tiny bristles of iron wire and is of the same sort used to clean armor after battle. On the bristles grows a pale mint mold which tastes of freshly cut lime.

When used to polish any metal clean, it makes the object impossibly reflective, returning an order of magnitude more light than is shone upon it until the next time it is in moonlight.
