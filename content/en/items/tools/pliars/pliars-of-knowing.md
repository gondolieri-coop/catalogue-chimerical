## Pliars of Knowing

This pair of pliars is made from gold and silver wire twisted and barbed, its teeth made from small rough rubies. While holding them, the bearer feels a physical jolt of intense desire when seeing others with wealth.

Holding these pliars grants the bearer vague understanding of whether or not someone's wealth was acquired unjustly; the tighter they are gripped, the more clarity the bearer has and the more welling rage they feel.
