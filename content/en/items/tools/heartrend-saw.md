## Heartrend Saw

This little handsaw is unbelievably extravagant and impractical, made of silver with iron teeth forge welded on. Between the teeth, pale yellow mold furs.

The donator noted that this saw can be used on oneself to remove any and all romantic feelings toward someone, the mold furring more thickly. If ingested, the mold induces vivid dreams of loves consumed by the saw.
