## Archer's Kin

This small whetstone is surprisingly chiseled from amethyst, its face roughened with a thousand tiny chips shaped like arrowheads. It never needs lubrication.

When used to sharpen an arrowhead, the shaft that head is affixed to flies in a perfectly flat trajectory until out of the archer's sight.
