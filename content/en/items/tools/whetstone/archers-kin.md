## Archer's Kin

This small whetstone is surprisingly chiseled from amethyst, its face roughened with a thousand
tiny chips shaped like arrowheads. It never needs lubrication.

A gift from an artisan seeking enlightenment who agreed to be interviewed about the work under
the Truthing dweomer. When used to sharpen an arrowhead, the shaft that head is affixed to flies
in a perfectly flat trajectory until out of the archer's sight. Additional notes, interview
record, and analysis will be provided with purchase.
