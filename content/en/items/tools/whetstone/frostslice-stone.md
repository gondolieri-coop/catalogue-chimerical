## Frostslice Stone

This massive whetstone is set into an ironoak block carved with a hundred cut-apart shields, their insignia marred with a smeared red snowflake.

Purchased at a gladiator auction, I discovered this work's effects via strenuous experimentation. Any implement sharpened on this whetstone becomes impossibly sharp and cold, almost unbearable to hold. It cuts through anything, but to hold it for more than a few moments is to risk frostbite. The next time the sun rises, the blade becomes dull and temperate.
