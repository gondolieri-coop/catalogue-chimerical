## Bloodgrin Saw

This porcelain handled woodsaw has a bronze blade, the teeth immaculate but shaped like a terrifyingly bloodstained grin.

Anything cut with this saw appears to bleed, regardless of material, seeping a small amount of fresh blood. Whatever is cut away with this saw remains weightless, floating in the air.
