## Drakefoe Trowel

This pointing trowel is hafted with ironoak in the uncomfortable shape of a distorted and snarling drake. The bronze blade is surprisingly sturdy for being wafer thin.

While held, all drakes which can smell or see the bearer hunger mightily for their flesh, pursuing them aggressively. The trowel pierces their hides with ease; any drake killed with this trowel whose bones are kept and cemented together with it animate as guardians while the moon is risen.
