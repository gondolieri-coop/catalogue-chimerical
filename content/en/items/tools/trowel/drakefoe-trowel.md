## Drakefoe Trowel

This pointing trowel is hafted with ironoak in the uncomfortable shape of a distorted and
snarling drake. The bronze blade is surprisingly sturdy for being wafer thin.

This heretical work was turned in by a supplicant who claimed it from a recalcitrant after
seeing it used; While held, all drakes which can smell or see the bearer hunger mightily for
their flesh, pursuing them aggressively. The trowel pierces their hides with ease; any drake
killed with this trowel whose bones are kept and cemented together with it animate as guardians
while the moon is risen. These authorlessly working automatons reportedly last indefinitely if
not destroyed. Purchase includes the remains of two such automatons.
