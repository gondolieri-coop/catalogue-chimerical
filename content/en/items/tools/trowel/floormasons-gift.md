## Floormason's Gift

This floating trowel's blade is made of solid gold set with tiny bricks of variegated jewels; when light strikes the bricks they cast a hypnotizing dance of refracted color.

This trowel never seems capable of producing a flat surface when used over wet cement; pressing it over solid stone creates a perfectly flat and level surface.
