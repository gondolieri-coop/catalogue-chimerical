## Stylus of Forgotten Visions

This charred oak stylus is wrapped in spiraling opaline scrollwork of dancing flames consuming illegible script. It is always comfortably warm in the hand.

This stylus easily marks even the hardest and coldest surfaces as if they were pliable wax; anything written or sketched with it is entirely forgotten as soon as the user lets go of the stylus but merely seeing the words brings vivid visualization of the material to mind.
