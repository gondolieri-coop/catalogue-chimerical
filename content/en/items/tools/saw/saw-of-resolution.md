## Saw of Resolution

This pocket chain saw's pale handle is pitted and marred like the moon, its teeth made from rusting iron; it smells strongly of jasmine while held in both hands.

Purchased at auction without any notes, I discovered and verified Using this saw brings the sawyer to a meditative state where they can think about nothing but the last event that angered them; while sawing, time dilates for them, ending only when they resolve their anger.
