## Bowyer's Dedication

This two-person crosscut saw's handles are uncomfortably studded with arrowhead peridots; between the teeth, a furry green mold accumulates with every cut.

Using this saw is extraordinarily tiring, rendering sawyers exhausted after mere minutes of use. The mold can be infused into a tea to render immunity to the saw's effect and enable the sawyers to see in perfect clarity regardless of lighting conditions.
