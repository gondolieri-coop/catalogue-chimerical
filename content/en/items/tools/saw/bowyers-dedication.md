## Bowyer's Dedication

This two-person crosscut saw's handles are uncomfortably studded with arrowhead peridots; between the teeth, a furry green mold accumulates with every cut.

Donated by a guest of our Farewell Ward, I was able to validate his claims about this work's effects via experimentation. Using this saw is extraordinarily tiring, rendering sawyers exhausted after mere minutes of use. The mold can be infused into a tea to render immunity to the saw's effect and enable the sawyers to see in perfect clarity regardless of lighting conditions.
