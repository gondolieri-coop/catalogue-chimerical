## Hundredhand Kohl Stylus

This thin ironoak stylus is used to apply kohl powder to the eyes and has a thin lavender silk ribbon depicting entwined fingers. Close inspection shows that each pair of hands is different, never repeating.

When used to apply kohl to one's own eyes, the user finds their steps light, almost bounding from earth with the slightest effort. When applied to anyone else, they step slowly and surely with a resounding thud, as if weighed down by responsibility.
