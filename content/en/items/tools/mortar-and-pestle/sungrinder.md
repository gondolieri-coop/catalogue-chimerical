## Sungrinder

This heavy granite mortar and pestle are both ringed with undulating bronze flames, the pestle stained deeply red.

Purchased at auction without any notes, I discovered this work's effects via experimentation. Anything ground in the mortar desperately desires to be ignited by the smallest spark; when it is, all nearby fires go out and a light as bright as the sun explodes, affecting everyone whose hands were not on the mortar or pestle while grinding.
