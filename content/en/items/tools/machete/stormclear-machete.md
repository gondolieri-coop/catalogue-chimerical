## Stormclear Machete

This otherwise plain machete's thick spine is studded with tiny topaz stones zig-zagging like lighting. Beneath a cloudless sky, it hums impatiently.

Donated by a merchant seeking enlightenment who attested to this work's effects via the Truthing dweomer. When used to clear away living matter the blade never seems quite sharp enough; beneath a raging storm, it cuts through anything, crackling with barely contained power, each swing arcing powerfully.
