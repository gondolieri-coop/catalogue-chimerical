## Stoneforge Tongs

These wrought iron tongs grow a furry orange mold at their tips; while held, the mold grows and heats, eventually glowing white hot, though they're always ice cold to the bearer's touch.

Nothing held by these tongs seems to heat in anyway except for stone, which becomes malleable like heated metal. If the mold is scraped free and ingested it suffuses the body with unbearable heat cooled only by ingesting stones.
