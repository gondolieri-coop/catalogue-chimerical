## Stoneforge Tongs

These wrought iron tongs grow a furry orange mold at their tips; while held, the mold grows and heats, eventually glowing white hot, though they're always ice cold to the bearer's touch.

Donated by a youth guest of our Good Morrow Ward seeking enlightenment. With their remembrances, I was able to analyze and confirm the work's effects. Nothing held by these tongs seems to heat in anyway except for stone, which becomes malleable like heated metal. If the mold is scraped free and ingested it suffuses the body with unbearable heat cooled only by ingesting stones.
