## Carver's Cheat

These porcelain tongs are tipped with caps of Pentolan marble, their faces carved with people dancing in the Catacombs. Beneath the ground they hum happily, expectantly.

Discovered by one of our supplicants on an expedition into the Undercity; the supplicant provided their notes and accompanied me during confirmatory experimentation. Anything gripped with these tongs slowly metamorphoses into Pentolan marble; Any object carved from Pentolan marble slowly animates, if gripped underground.
