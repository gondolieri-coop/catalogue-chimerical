## Heavy Supper Fork

This serving fork is carved from ironoak, its handle carved like an orchid, its tines stained darkly red.

This work was acquired via gift exchange with the Bloodless, a butcher's guild; I verified the claimed effects via thorough experimentation. Any meat served with this fork fills the eaters heavily, as if their weight had suddenly increased by an order of magnitude and lasting until fully digested.
