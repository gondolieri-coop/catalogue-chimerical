## Nutrition's Fire Fork

This small wrought iron dinner fork is twisted, malformed by heat. Near open flame it writhes.

Purchased at auction, I was able to confirm the claimed effects of this work myself. Any food
speared and eaten from this fork, no matter how plain or rotten, never satiates and instead
increases hunger. Each bite is as nutritious as a full days meal and burns the tongue.
