## Shipwright's Friend

This slick chisel's blade is made from a single piece of jade carved with a tiny tree thick with olives on one face; every shaving made by it smells intensely of fresh-pressed olives.

Holding this chisel seems to slow the whole world down; when used, the carpenter finds that they are able to accomplish an hour's work in a mere minute.
