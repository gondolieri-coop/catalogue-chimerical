## Shipwright's Friend

This slick chisel's blade is made from a single piece of jade carved with a tiny tree thick with
olives on one face; every shaving made by it smells intensely of fresh-pressed olives.

Purchased at auction, I confirmed the annotated claims about this work's via experimentation.
Holding this chisel seems to slow the whole world down; when used, the carpenter finds that they
are able to accomplish an hour's work in a mere minute.
