## Companion's Tears Shears

This pair of shears has blades made from dented and scuffed bronze spearheads engraved with tear
drops. When not held, they hum ominously.

This work was willed to us by a guest of our Farewell Ward, the work's effects described
plainly; I confirmed them with a willing volunteer according to The Great Treatises. The bearer
of these shears sees strands connecting them to everyone around them; cutting the threads erases
both people from the other's memory forever.

Of all the items here, this one still scares me the most. Merely thinking of a world in which we
have forgotten one another chills my marrow.
