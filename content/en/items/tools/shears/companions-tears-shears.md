## Companion's Tears Shears

This pair of shears has blades made from dented and scuffed bronze spearheads engraved with tear drops. When not held, they hum ominously.

The bearer of these shears sees strands connecting them to everyone around them; cutting the threads erases both people from the other's memory forever.
