## Lunar Beauty Fan

This large fan is wrought from tarnished silver wrapped in opaline tendrils. The dimpled and
marred feathers expand to a full circle around the handle, mirroring the watchful moon.

A gift from a Pentolan florist seeking enlightenment, he demonstrated this work's effect to my
satisfaction. When this fan is waved it produces no noticeable current, though plants sway
before it; any plant moved by this fan will bloom beautifully during the next moonrise and die
at moonset.
