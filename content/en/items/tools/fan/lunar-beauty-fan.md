## Lunar Beauty Fan

This large fan is wrought from tarnished silver wrapped in opaline tendrils. The dimpled and marred feathers expand to a full circle around the handle, mirroring the watchful moon.

When this fan is waved it produces no noticeable current, though plants sway before it; any plant moved by this fan will bloom beautifully during the next moonrise and die at moonset.
