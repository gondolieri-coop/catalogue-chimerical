## Linecutter Shears

A pair of copper shears, the handles banded with porcelain etched like crashing waves. The blades are shaped like the prows of warships rather than practical triangles.

Sold as part of an auction of items recovered from pirates, verified to be capable of slicing through anything the bearer believes to belong to a sworn enemy.
