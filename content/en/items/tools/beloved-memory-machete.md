## Beloved Memory Machete

This copper machete has acid-etched imagery of seven people holding hands and leaning against each other. The handle is wrapped in silver wire. When held aloft, the scent of jasmine fills the air.

The bearer of this impossibly sharp and durable machete finds that, when used to clear brush, their mind drifts back towards their loved ones. If used on flesh, memories of their loved ones fade forever with each stroke.
