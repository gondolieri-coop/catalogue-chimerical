## Mooniron Mortar and Pestle

This mortar and pestle are made from bluish granite, though cracks in the mortar have been filled with iron polished smooth. In moonlight, the pestle is twice as heavy but seems capable of grinding anything.

When used to prepare herbs, the keeper of this culinary tool finds that their entire prep work flows fast and smooth as if nothing can go wrong. Any meal eaten with crushed ingredients from this mortar and pestle taste distincly metallic, but time seems to pass 3/4 as fast for the eaters til their next meal.
