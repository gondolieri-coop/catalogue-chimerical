## Brush of the Raptor

This small ink brush's handle is porcelain glazed with the lifelike image of a Pentolan falcon soaring, with bristles from an eyas of the same.

Purchased at auction without notes, I was able to discover and analyze this work via experimentation: anything marked with this brush becomes weightless until the ink dries; it always uses much more ink than expected.
