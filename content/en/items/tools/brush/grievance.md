## Grievance

This large olive-handled brush's bristles are impossibly thin strands of carved jade,
surprisingly supple and leaving an indelible green ink on any flesh they touch.

Turned in by a penitent supplicant who used it without proper consulation with the Great
Treatises, I confirmed the effect via the Truthing dweomer during debrief prior to their
penitent consultation. Anyone using this brush cannot help but write out their deepest held fury
on the nearest surface; as they write, the same words are tattooed on the source of their ire.
In moonlight, the script glows visibly through any material, revealing itself to everyone
nearby.
