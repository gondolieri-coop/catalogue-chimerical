## Grievance

This large olive-handled brush's bristles are impossibly thin strands of carved jade, surprisingly supple and leaving an indelible green ink on any flesh they touch.

Anyone using this brush cannot help but write out their deepest held fury on the nearest surface; as they write, the same words are tattooed on the source of their ire. In moonlight, the script glows visibly through any material, revealing itself to everyone nearby.
