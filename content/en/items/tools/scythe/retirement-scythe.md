## Retirement Scythe

This scythe's blade is a viciously sharp halbard carved from Pentolan marble, a riot of colorful
silk tassels dangle from the back handle.

Purchased from a local florist, I was able to confirm her claims about this work's effects via
experimentation: any plants reaped in sunlight with this tool rapidly recover, growing to their
original state by the time the moon reaches its next zenith. Any plants reaped without the sun
wither and die, though twice as much produce seems to accumulate from every cut.
