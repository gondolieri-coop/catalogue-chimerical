## Retirement Scythe

This scythe's blade is a viciously sharp halbard carved from Pentolan marble, a riot of colorful silk tassels dangle from the back handle.

Any plants reaped in sunlight with this tool rapidly recover, growing to their original state by the time the moon reaches its next zenith. Any plants reaped without the sun wither and die, though twice as much produce seems to accumulate from every cut.
