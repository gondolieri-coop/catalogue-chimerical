## Tireless Handtruck

This simple wooden handtruck has a too-thin iron lever at the bottom but nevertheless is capable of bearing any load lifted upon it.

When used to transport anything, the user of this handtruck finds that they are tireless, able to work for hours without feeling any strain, though observers note that they do show it, nonetheless. When the user lays down to sleep, they remain in a deep slumber for as twice as many hours as they used the handtruck.
