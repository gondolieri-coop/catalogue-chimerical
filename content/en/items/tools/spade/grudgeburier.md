## Grudgeburier

This silver bladed spade's handle is made of porcelain glazed with flames consuming a great estate, destroying generations of wealth.

If the bearer of this spade buries their most prized possession with it the ground smokes and glows, the item appearing in the depiction on the handle. The first person whose name is spoken over the smoldering ground experiences terrible misfortune at the next zenith of the moon.
