## Grudgeburier

This silver bladed spade's handle is made of porcelain glazed with flames consuming a great estate, destroying generations of wealth.

This work was recovered by a supplicant after it was used against several of our own. The previous owner was questioned per The Great Treatises and explained its use via the Truthing Dweomer. If the bearer of this spade buries their most prized possession with it the ground smokes and glows, the item appearing in the depiction on the handle. The first person whose name is spoken over the smoldering ground experiences terrible and violent misfortune at the next zenith of the moon.
