## Moonthunder Rod

This small silver rod has a spike on one end and is wrapped in opaline scrollwork of lightning falling from the moon.

Purchased at auction, I was able to confirm the minimal notes it was sold with under appropriate conditions. The rod can be placed into anything with ease; if anchored into something and in direct moonlight a blast of lightning will strike moments later, destroying whatever the rod was anchored to. Until the next moonrise, the bearer can hurl a bolt of lightning for each that fell in this way.
