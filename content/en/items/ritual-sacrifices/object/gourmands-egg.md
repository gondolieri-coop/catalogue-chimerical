## Gourmand's Egg

This large silver egg is clustered with dozens of small gems and has had half a dozen apparent
bites chewed out of it; the bitten sections are bloodstained.

Purchased from a debtor seeking succor, he attested to this work's effects via Truthing dweomer.
Anyone who bites out a gem from the egg and chews it up will forever after taste anything safe
to eat as if it is whatever they most want to taste at that moment; anything dangerous to them
instead tastes like sewage. Eating from the egg is dangerous, damaging the mouth but deadening
all nerves.
