## Basket of Held Memory

This thornwillow basket has a silk cover stitched with golden thread depicting the sun above a peaceful glade, strewn with various items.

Anything placed into the basket is lost forever, stitched into the cover; the bearer can perfectly recall any memories made while holding the lost item, regardless of whose mind they live in.
