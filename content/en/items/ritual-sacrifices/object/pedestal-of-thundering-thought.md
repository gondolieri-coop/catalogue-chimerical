## Pedestal of Thundering Thought

This squat Pentolan marble pedestal is capped with a mirror of bronze, the surface of which causes a painful shock when touched.

If an item is placed upon this pedestal beneath a clear sky it will be destroyed in a sudden and vicious bolt of lightning. For the next hour, the person who placed the item can hear the thoughts of its rightful owner. For the rest of the day, they are deafened by the echoes of thunder.
