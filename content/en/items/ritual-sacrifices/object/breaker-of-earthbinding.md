## Breaker of Earthbinding

This smith's hammer is made entirely from bronze, etched with dozens of destroyed implements of battle. Picking it up causes a powerful jolt to run up the arm, forcing fingers to clench tight.

If the bearer breaks something they own with this hammer gravity loosens its grip on them; for as many moonrises as seasons they owned the item, they leap and move as if they weighed a tenth as much.
