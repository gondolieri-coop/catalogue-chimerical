## Breaker of Earthbinding

This smith's hammer is made entirely from bronze, etched with dozens of destroyed implements of
battle. Picking it up causes a powerful jolt to run up the arm, forcing fingers to clench tight.

This work was one of the belongings left in the will of a reformed Pentolan; I was able to piece
together its effect by discussion with their survivors and confirm it myself. If the bearer
breaks something they own with this hammer gravity loosens its grip on them; for as many
moonrises as seasons they owned the item, they leap and move as if they weighed a tenth as much.
