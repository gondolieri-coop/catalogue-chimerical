## Smolderforge

This small firestarter is inlaid with rubies in the shape of a burning axe; it is always uncomfortably hot to the touch.

The bearer can use this item to set fire to any part of their panoply, rendering it to ruin in mere minutes. Any weapon touched to the smoldering remains is imbued with forgefire, burning through anything and everything until the ruins cool completely.
