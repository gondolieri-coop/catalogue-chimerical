## Smolderforge

This small firestarter is inlaid with rubies in the shape of a burning axe; it is always
uncomfortably hot to the touch.

This work was donated by one of the rare Gondolieri seeking enlightenment and demonstrated to my
satisfaction. The bearer can use this work to set fire to any part of their panoply, rendering
it to ruin in mere minutes. Any weapon touched to the smoldering remains is imbued with
forgefire, burning through anything and everything until the ruins cool completely.
