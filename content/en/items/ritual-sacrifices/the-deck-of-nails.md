## The Deck of Nails

This small box is carved of Pentolan marble in the shape of a box of playing cards common to Pentola. When opened, all nearby light dims until the lid is closed again. Inside, a deck of 40 plain linen cards, a handful of them marked with pips eerily reminiscent of fingernails.

The bearer of this box may pull their fingernails and place them upon a blank card; each fingernail so placed grants one minute of perfect health, near immortality, to the bearer. A Fingernail so used never grows back.
