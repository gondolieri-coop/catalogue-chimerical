## Padma's Blessing

This small statue of a giant padma flower smells like its namesake and has petals of rusted iron. On its base, a sharp pin.

If the bearer pricks themself with the statue, the flesh around the mark necrotizes and their flesh warps to present the same flower. The spike stamens can be removed and pressed into another living being, infecting them with the parasitic plant too. For sunrise the plant is not spread, more of the host's flesh decays. An infected host is immune to disease and poison.
