## Padma's Blessing

This small statue of a giant padma flower smells like its namesake and has petals of rusted iron. On its base, a sharp pin.

Recovered from a mournful guest of our Farewell Ward who had been paid to use this work on behalf of Spire Basilisco; before their long sleep, they confirmed this work's effects via the Truthing dweomer. If the bearer pricks themself with the statue, the flesh around the mark necrotizes and their flesh warps to present the same flower. The spike stamens can be removed and pressed into another living being, infecting them with the parasitic plant too. For every sunrise the plant is not spread, more of the host's flesh decays. An infected host is immune to disease and poison. While I have preserved this work in accordance with my duties, I do recommend that it be kept in archive or destroyed when sufficiently studied.
