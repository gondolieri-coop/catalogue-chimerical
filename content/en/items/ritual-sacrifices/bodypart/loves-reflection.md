## Love's Reflection

This mirror is made from meticulously polished gold, chased with a love poem in tiny iron script.

A gift from an ancient Skylion Spire guardian seeking enlightenment, she attested sorrowfully to this work's effects via the Truthing dweomer. Looking into the mirror shows not oneself but their beloved. If looking in direct sunlight, all wounds and illness fade from the reflection and person alike; if in moonlight, they age rapidly and terribly.
