## Moonmarrow Hammer

This tinkerer's hammer has a head carved from ironoak to look like the moon; its haft is always slick, ready to slip out of hand.

Purchased at auction, I was able to verify the primary effect of this work: the bearer can use this hammer to crush any bone in their own body with the slightest touch, filling them with tephra, supercharging any and all magic until the next moonrise. Unforunately, I also discovered that a bone broken this way never heals, not even with all the knowledge available to our healers in The Great Treatise. I advise any further study to proceed with utmost caution.
