## Moonmarrow Hammer

This tinkerer's hammer has a head carved from ironoak to look like the moon; its haft is always slick, ready to slip out of hand.

The bearer can use this hammer to crush any bone in their own body with the slightest touch, filling them with tephra, supercharging any and all magic until the next moonrise. A bone broken this way never heals.
