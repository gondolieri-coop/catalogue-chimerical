## Infernal Tongue

This small bronze effigy of a fire-ruined tongue is surprisingly wet to the touch.

When pressed to one's own tongue it painfully destroys that organ, blackening it immediately. Thereafter, the ritualist's voice echoes and crackles like flame and what they name thrice will burst into flames if they can see it.
