## Infernal Tongue

This small bronze effigy of a fire-ruined tongue is surprisingly wet to the touch.

Donated by a dilligent student of our Garden who had inherited this work from their aunt and
attested to the effects via the Truthing dweomer. When pressed to one's own tongue it painfully
destroys that organ, blackening it immediately. Thereafter, the ritualist's voice echoes and
crackles like flame and what they name thrice will burst into flames if they can see it.
