## Familial Feastbowl

This bowl is carved from a single piece of Pentolan marble, edged in faces which on inspection always seem to be people the viewer knows and cares for.

Any food placed in this bowl is delectable and fully nourishing to everyone else; to the owner, all food is tasteless unless and until a new owner offers them food from the bowl.
