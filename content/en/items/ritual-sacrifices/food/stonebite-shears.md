## Stonebite Shears

This bronze pruning shear is bedecked with small emeralds, it's blades shaped like Pentolan
playing cards with marble statues for the Matron and Captain.

Donated by a desperate (brief) guest of our Farewell Ward, he attested to this work's effects
via the Truthing dweomer. Any fruit clipped with these shears turns to a porous clay, easily
chewable. Anyone who eats this fruit slowly turns to stone, starting with their teeth; if they
do not bite someone else to transfer the effect by the next sunrise, they will become a statue.
I strongly recommend further analysis only be performed in accordance with the Great Treatises.

In all the long hours before he passed, I think only the whispered song you sang to him while I
distracted the others ever gave him any comfort. He seemed so peaceful in those last moments,
frozen forever with your voice in his ear.
