## Stonebite Shears

This bronze pruning shear is bedecked with small emeralds, it's blades shaped like Pentolan playing cards with marble statues for the Matron and Captain.

Donated by a desperate (brief) guest of our Farewell Ward, he attested to this work's effects via the Truthing dweomer. Any fruit clipped with these shears turns to a porous clay, easily chewable. Anyone who eats this fruit slowly turns to stone, starting with their teeth; if they do not bite someone else to transfer the effect by the next sunrise, they will become a statue. I strongly recommend further analysis only be performed in accordance with the Great Treatises.
