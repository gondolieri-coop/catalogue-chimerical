## Stonebite Shears

This bronze pruning shear is bedecked with small emeralds, it's blades shaped like Pentolan playing cards with marble statues for the Matron and Captain.

Any fruit clipped with these shears turns to a porous clay, easily chewable. Anyone who eats this fruit slowly turns to stone, starting with their teeth; if they do not bite someone else to transfer the effect by the next sunrise, they will become a statue.
