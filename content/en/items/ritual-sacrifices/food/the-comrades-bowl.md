## The Comrade's Bowl

This shallow olive bowl is entirely unremarkable save for the golden spear head hammered into its belly and the fact that it is always and forever damp.

If the keeper of this bowl places their own food into the bowl, they find that it is incredibly nutritious and tasty, feeding half-a-gross of other people with a single morsel. The keeper of the bowl, however, gains no nourishment from that or any meal for three days.
