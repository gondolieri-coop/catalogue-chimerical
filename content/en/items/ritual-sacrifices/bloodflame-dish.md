## Bloodflame Dish

This soup dish is carved from a single piece of Pentolan marble, a roiling flame of stone spreading from its belly which is stained dark with blood.

When food is mixed with the consumer's own blood, the consumer finds themself utterly immune to flame, smoke, and heat until they have finished digesting the meal; at that point, the consumer becomes violently ill for a day, vomiting flammable blood.
