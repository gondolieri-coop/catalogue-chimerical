## Bloodflame Stone

This small jasper pebble is polished smooth and soft to the touch, almost squishy when held between two fingers. The swirls in its surface are remeniscent of a starting flame, just now catching hold.

When pressed into an open wound, the bearer finds that the wound will not close and burns painfully, rendering the limb it was placed in nearly useless. In exchange, however, the bearer may touch any friendly beast, imbuing it with the spirit of flame, granting it immunity to fire even as it ignites into living flame. The stone cannot be removed except by amputation.
