## Anatomy of Partnership

This sketchbook is half-filled with disturbingly accurate anatomical studies of various people, the copper plates that cover it etched with a pleasingly abstract rendering of a human heart.

We verified the prior owners claim; anyone who details a loved one with their own hand in this book creates a link between the artist and the subject, such that ailments and injuries upon the subject are rendered upon the artist and the illustration alike instead of the subject. Erasing an illustration severs the link but reportedly kills the subject immediately.

## Bonfire of Opulence

This painting of a wealthy person framed in porcelain flame depicts them looking on as a pile of visible wealth burns, as Pentolan Spirons do every seventeen years, a ritualized rejection of the wealth they continue to possess.

The owner of this painting can push any item they own into the painting, slowly rendering it into the painting. The owner can later pull a copy of any item they placed in the painting, but it crumbles into ash at the next moon zenith.

## Flakehearth

This beautifully abstract rendering of a burning snowflake features a sliver of pale blue diamond set into the center of the thick parchment, forming the snowflake itself.

When unfurled, everyone nearby finds even the coldest day easy to endure, though their eyes slowly take on the color of the diamond. This effect fades after about an hour.

## Fortunate Foundling

This charcoal drawing of a child wearing fabulous clothes and draped with jewels is sketched on a thin sheet of ironoak. Dangling from one corner, a handful of tiny iron charms, three missing.

When one of the attached charms is removed and fed to someone younger than the owner, the child miraculously comes into wealth and luck at every turn; however, equal misfortune befalls the owner.

## Friendflame

This inked illustration of three friends dancing around a fire is pinned to a wafer thin sheet of Pentolan marble polished to a mirror shine.

When three or more people join hands and dance around a flame in the presence of this illustration, they are imbued with the dance of the flames commensurate to their magnitude until the fire dies.

## Ink of Youth

This children's sketchbook features named stick figures of various people in a dozen different hands. The cover is marked with a surprisingly ornate rune, almost beautiful, though reading it makes one's eyes droop.

Purchased at auction and verified, anyone who draws a stick figure in this book and signs it with their name will regain as many years of youth as they draw lines for their figure. Drawing a second figure, however, reverses the effects threefold.

## Ashstorm Vase

This tall, thin porcelain vase is decorated with an almost pleasantly abstract rendering of a pyroclastic flow; its neck is wrapped with a silk ribbon from which dangles a ring of polished ironoak.

Any cut stem placed in this vase grows as if properly grafted and grown in the most fertile volcanic soil, never wilting.

## Firecracked Chamber Pot

This old, cracked chamber pot is made of pale pink porcelain and repaired with bronze to fill cracks like licking flames. Firelight in the presence of this pot dims and flickers, making the area pleasantly dark.

For every year that this chamber pot is used daily an additional crack filled with bronze slowly grows. Whoever used the pot at least daily during that year finds themself inured against any illnesses or poisons consumed.

## Magmatic Drake Cup

This simple earthenware cup is a perfectly shaped cylinder, as wide as it is tall, marred only by the Pentolan obsession with imagery, in this case depicting a bonedrake with molten stone (stylized with tiny rubies) dripping from its bony plates.

Anyone who drinks from this cup feels intensely warm, sweating despite even the coolest night breeze. Any drake bonded with the drinker shares the effect, only amplified tenfold, to the point their bony plates sear a fresh egg instantly.

## Moonhoard Mug

This brilliant blue mug is beset with scores of tiny gems in a fractal depiction of riches raining from a pearl moon; the surface of the glazed and fired clay is polished to a mirror sheen.

When drinking from this cup, all observers find themselves impressed by the drinker's good taste and bearing, making them the most interesting and laudable person in the room. The drinker is similarly overcome with feelings of self satisfaction and a desire for more, more, more accolades.

## Rich Rooster Dish

This wide plate is slightly convex, featuring an inlaid silver rooster pecking at polished copper card money. Picking it up always causes a distant crowing call to be heard.

When used to feed a creature, that creature's plumage or fur slowly turns into precious metals which can be plucked or sheared.

## Stonethought Kettle

This kettle is crafted of Pentolan marble and features surprisingly abstract opaline scrollwork depicting insect-like creatures beneath a copse of massive angular trees carved into the kettle itself.

Drinking any tea from this kettle causes a curious change in the perception of time; a single sip turns seconds into minutes, though the drinker cannot move any faster during their sip.

## Burning Matron

This bust of a Pentolan matron with flames for hair is surprisingly lifelike, down to every wrinkle in her serenely thoughtful face. Her eyes, looking upward, are made of porcelain, and what appears to be dried blood has trickled from her ears.

Thinking while looking into a fire while touching this bust causes the flames themselves to visualize your thoughts, a flickering panorama.

## Dawnguardian

This stone toy soldier fits in the hand and features a spearwoman holding her own helmeted head under her arm, her spearblade bright with polished iron. In every crease, pale red mold seeps like fungal blood.

The bearer of this tiny statue can scrape up a modicum of the mold, prick their finger on the spear, and mix the two together to ingest; after doing so, the statue grows to the same size as them and takes orders until the sun rises again.

## Lover's Feast

This bronze statue depicts lovers feading each other chunks of bread dripping honey, their limbs entwined. Their lips are stained red with dried blood.

Any food eaten in the presence of these statues without a loved one robs the food of all taste; even the simplest fare is delectable if shared with a friend or partner.

## Moonflame Pillar

This bronze statue of a pillaring flame is set into an octagonal plinth of Pentolan marble, lavendar shot through with pale green veins.

In the presence of this statue, even the dimmest conditions are navigable as if brightly lit, though in moonlight only surfaces illuminated by that celestial body are visible at all.

## Moonkissed Pond

This diorama of a marble moon suspended over a pond of saphhire is pleasantly abstract, not bothering to mimic proper proportions; the surface of the moon is polished somehow to feel like velvet. Beneath the flat surface of the pond, a dozen tiny precious stones.

Any stone placed on the pond's surface sinks slowly in moonlight, shrinking to a tenth its size. Retrieval of the gems does not seem possible without breaking the moon, based on my research.

## Sea Eagle's Fury

This marble statue features a sea eagle rising from the waves, its eyes inlaid with bronze flames, its talons blood stained.

Purchased from a falconer, we verified that, when kept in an aviary for at least nine sunrises, the birds who roost near this statue can burst into flame on the command of whoever's blood last splashed on the eagle's talons.

## Drakerider's Bloodaxes

This card-sized oak tablet features a pair of crossed porcelain battle axes in the style often carried by Pentolan drakeriders, their blades stained with dried blood.

Smearing one's own blood onto the blade of either axe allows the bearer to pull it free from the tablet, upon which they grow to full size and cleave through anything but iron with ease. They shrink again when the blood covering them dries.

## Hoardeater Tablet

This clay tablet is shaped like a cackling merchant in eerily lifelike detail, gazing at a hoard of gold and silver playing cards falling through their fingers. In their yawning mouth grows a mold like dried blood.

When this tablet is hung in a room, everyone who can see it feels a growing desire to count their material wealth. We verified the claim of the prior owner that scraping the mold and mixing it into a tea allows the drinker to eat precious objects, staving off illness and aging for a time correlating to the perceived value of the objects eaten.

## Slowplay Tablet

This Pentolan marble tablet features parents embracing while they watch small children race around a garden; the faces of the children are marred, replaced with a rune.

Any room this tablet has been displayed in for a moonrise makes everyone in it move frustratingly slow, at no more than half their normal speed for even the simplest actions.

## Stormfruit Etching

This copper plate is etched with an almost pleasantly interpretive scene of lightning striking a willow tree growing strange fruit. Where the lightning blasts the tree, tiny slivers of iron have been carefully inserted; picking it up always causes an uncomfortable shock.

Any tree this tablet is nailed to will be struck by lightning whenever a storm blows through; if it survives the blast, it the fruit from the etching grow from its branches. When eaten, they taste of ozone and the consumer's breath is filled with lightning that crackles between their teeth.

## War Councillors

This willow-woven tablet secures a bas relief of warriors in the Pentolan panoply huddled around a dirt map, conversing and holding their weapons. In flickering light, it hums softly, like a distant conversation barely heard.

Plans made in the presence of this tablet come together with ease, participants able to cut through language barriers and see second and third order effects of any proposition.

## Wintermarket

This silver tablet is small enough to hold in one hand and inlaid with aquamarine and topaz, depicting a bustling snow-blanketed market with dozens of people trading and conversing. The entire thing is lined with iridescent opaline scrollwork of tiling snowflakes.

When the bearer of this tablet's breath frosts in the air, they find that haggling comes easy to them, as does accurate appraisal for any goods being sold. Anyone attempting to mislead the bearer finds their lips blue visibly while doing so.
