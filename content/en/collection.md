## Burning Matron

This bust of a Pentolan matron with flames for hair is surprisingly lifelike, down to every wrinkle in her serenely thoughtful face. Her eyes, looking upward, are made of porcelain, and what appears to be dried blood has trickled from her ears.

Thinking while looking into a fire while touching this bust causes the flames themselves to visualize your thoughts, a flickering panorama.

## Dawnguardian

This stone toy soldier fits in the hand and features a spearwoman holding her own helmeted head under her arm, her spearblade bright with polished iron. In every crease, pale red mold seeps like fungal blood.

The bearer of this tiny statue can scrape up a modicum of the mold, prick their finger on the spear, and mix the two together to ingest; after doing so, the statue grows to the same size as them and takes orders until the sun rises again.

## Lover's Feast

This bronze statue depicts lovers feading each other chunks of bread dripping honey, their limbs entwined. Their lips are stained red with dried blood.

Any food eaten in the presence of these statues without a loved one robs the food of all taste; even the simplest fare is delectable if shared with a friend or partner.

## Moonflame Pillar

This bronze statue of a pillaring flame is set into an octagonal plinth of Pentolan marble, lavendar shot through with pale green veins.

In the presence of this statue, even the dimmest conditions are navigable as if brightly lit, though in moonlight only surfaces illuminated by that celestial body are visible at all.

## Moonkissed Pond

This diorama of a marble moon suspended over a pond of saphhire is pleasantly abstract, not bothering to mimic proper proportions; the surface of the moon is polished somehow to feel like velvet. Beneath the flat surface of the pond, a dozen tiny precious stones.

Any stone placed on the pond's surface sinks slowly in moonlight, shrinking to a tenth its size. Retrieval of the gems does not seem possible without breaking the moon, based on my research.

## Sea Eagle's Fury

This marble statue features a sea eagle rising from the waves, its eyes inlaid with bronze flames, its talons blood stained.

Purchased from a falconer, we verified that, when kept in an aviary for at least nine sunrises, the birds who roost near this statue can burst into flame on the command of whoever's blood last splashed on the eagle's talons.

## Drakerider's Bloodaxes

This card-sized oak tablet features a pair of crossed porcelain battle axes in the style often carried by Pentolan drakeriders, their blades stained with dried blood.

Smearing one's own blood onto the blade of either axe allows the bearer to pull it free from the tablet, upon which they grow to full size and cleave through anything but iron with ease. They shrink again when the blood covering them dries.

## Hoardeater Tablet

This clay tablet is shaped like a cackling merchant in eerily lifelike detail, gazing at a hoard of gold and silver playing cards falling through their fingers. In their yawning mouth grows a mold like dried blood.

When this tablet is hung in a room, everyone who can see it feels a growing desire to count their material wealth. We verified the claim of the prior owner that scraping the mold and mixing it into a tea allows the drinker to eat precious objects, staving off illness and aging for a time correlating to the perceived value of the objects eaten.

## Slowplay Tablet

This Pentolan marble tablet features parents embracing while they watch small children race around a garden; the faces of the children are marred, replaced with a rune.

Any room this tablet has been displayed in for a moonrise makes everyone in it move frustratingly slow, at no more than half their normal speed for even the simplest actions.

## Stormfruit Etching

This copper plate is etched with an almost pleasantly interpretive scene of lightning striking a willow tree growing strange fruit. Where the lightning blasts the tree, tiny slivers of iron have been carefully inserted; picking it up always causes an uncomfortable shock.

Any tree this tablet is nailed to will be struck by lightning whenever a storm blows through; if it survives the blast, it the fruit from the etching grow from its branches. When eaten, they taste of ozone and the consumer's breath is filled with lightning that crackles between their teeth.

## War Councillors

This willow-woven tablet secures a bas relief of warriors in the Pentolan panoply huddled around a dirt map, conversing and holding their weapons. In flickering light, it hums softly, like a distant conversation barely heard.

Plans made in the presence of this tablet come together with ease, participants able to cut through language barriers and see second and third order effects of any proposition.

## Wintermarket

This silver tablet is small enough to hold in one hand and inlaid with aquamarine and topaz, depicting a bustling snow-blanketed market with dozens of people trading and conversing. The entire thing is lined with iridescent opaline scrollwork of tiling snowflakes.

When the bearer of this tablet's breath frosts in the air, they find that haggling comes easy to them, as does accurate appraisal for any goods being sold. Anyone attempting to mislead the bearer finds their lips blue visibly while doing so.
